Great experience so far,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Phone randomly shuts off throughout the day with a charged battery. When this happens, the only way to turn the phone back on is to connect it to a charger. A few minutes later, the phone shuts itself off again, and the cycle continues. The phone is pretty much stock, no new apps. I paid a lot of money for this ""Certified Refurbished"" phone, and it did not deliver. Very flawed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
We purchased this for my wife after her phone was stolen.  This never worked quite right; the sound was always bad and it did not seem to have the storage it should.  Somehow the phone got locked and would not unlock. She took it to Apple.  They said it was a throw away model that they used in stores as demos and then tossed. They said the sound was set that way deliberately and that the phone should never have been sold.  Be warned.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Had a very smal scratch on the upper corner. But all in all was in great condition and well worth the purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars
My phone arrived in very good condition. I popped my sim card in and updated ios and I'm a happy camper.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"received the phone quite quickly.. looked like it was in good shape.. no scratches.. I'm writing this review 7 months after receiving the phone. For the most part, I'm pleased with it.. but 6 months after getting it (this past December), I couldn't keep a charge in it...and when I plugged it into the charger that came with the phone, it wouldn't charge at all.. I took it to a phone repair shop.. the battery was dead and the port was bad and had to be replaced.. And the charging cord was bad. I'm surprised that after only 6 months that the battery and port went bad.  So I don't know if they didn't check those two things when you recondition a phone, isn't putting a new battery in part of the reconditioning? As well as making sure the port is in good shape?  I only use my phone for talking and texting, so I'm not hard on it at all. and why wouldn't they give a new charging cord with the phone. They don't cost that much.. This is why I couldn't give them five stars.. It cost $102.00 to get everything fixed",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Love the phone, it's big lol . I'm just loving the fact that everything is working so far , came in good condition. Also if you feel like the phone won't charge, or when you put the charger in and it doesn't charge? Try the charge that it came with . & the charge that came with the phone ? May stop working . Because it's not an apple product , so you may have to use to buy an apple charger which isn't expensive",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I only got the phone 2 days ago for my daughter.  So if I don't update anything, everything is very good.  The phone was in new condition, not a scratch.  The charger is fine and the phone battery was at 90% on delivery.  We are very happy with the initial experience of this like new phone 6s Plus.  We got my son the Iphone 6s last year (refurbished), and it is still in excellent condition.  That's why we had no doubt about buying another phone.  Delivery was on time.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Like many I was skeptical on buying a refurb sight un-seen. This phone arrived the next day and was in great shape. The screen was scratch free except for 1 tiny 1/16th mark which I can't even see now when I put the glass screen protector on it. The whole thing works well and I'd order another one if the need arises.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I ordered 2 phones and I was pretty scare that it was going to be a bad deal but it turned out to be a good deal. the phones look new no visible scratches  shipping was a lot much faster than the expected date. so far I was able to connect my carrier with the phone and set it up, its working pretty good right now, we'll see how it keeps on working in the future",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Unbelievable!!!! I did NOT receive a ""Refurbished"" product. This was 100% USED. There's a difference. You can tell they paid no attention to the condition of this phone neither operationally or aesthetically. Deep gouged scratches in the screen, defective vibration performance, and the very poor battery health. Once it hits 50% battery it shoots to 1% and then dies. Nothing about this phone was actually refurbished, I might as well have just chanced Craigslist for half the price.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"The phone I received was in great physical condition but the touchscreen completely did not work on it.  Had to return and buy elsewhere locally due to time sensitivity.  Things like this need to be quality checked on a ""refurbished"" device.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"It is refurbished so I was scepical , but had it 6 months and everything is perfect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The phone is refurbished but internal issues do not seem to have been fixed. Sure, it works, but with all the stress you’ll go through from calls being dropped, being backed out of apps, randomly shutting down, etc. it’s definitely best to go to your service provider. I think having someone to hold accountable for the defects and someone who will actually work with you to fix those is better. SAVE YOUR MONEY!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I am pleased with the phone. There were a few marks on it and the screen, but I knew when you buy a refurbished phone you take that chance. It was able to be used with Ting and that was my major priority.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I brought this refurbished iphone 6s plus six months back and just today, after charging the phone overnight the phone stopped working.

Phone is in excellent shape. Put in T-Mobile prepaid sim works with no issues. Used the phone for a couple hours (iPhone 6s plus) no issues. However when I did the iOS 11.2.6 update after an hr phone randomly crashes has a glitchy screen like someone broke an lcd tv. So I don’t know if it’s the update or the phone otherwise it works well.,4.0 out of 5 stars
I got my phone days before it stayed it would and I was pleased. The phone had no scratches and no dents or scuffs. The battery was draining very fastly but that was expected with a phone this old.

"My husbands phone was stolen last week which is what prompted us to by this phone. We ordered it Friday and it arrive Wednesday through Amazon Prime... The phone looked great but once we got it activated with Verizon we realized the speakers were messed up when you play music, watch videos, your alarm goes off, or the phone rings. The sound is extremely distorted, hard to hear, and understand specially when having to talk on speak phone. Upset that the phone arrived like that. I know it’s refurbished but that should have been checked. After all we went through with having our original phone stolen it was just more added stress to receive a replacement with busted speakers.",2.0 out of 5 stars
