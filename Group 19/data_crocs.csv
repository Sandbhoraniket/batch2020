"I own 2 pair of Crocs women's Freesail and figured I'd try a pair of the classics.  The Freesail are much trimmer & narrower in width than the  women's Classics.  I love both.  The Classics are quite a bit boxier and wider in width  than the Freesail and the Classics seem to have a bit more  cushioning on the bottom.  Both work well for my problem feet which are usually sporting the Alegria brand shoes/sandals  for work.  However, on weekends and downtime, I prefer Crocs.  I have hammer toes  and deteriorating foot joints and have lost most of natural cushioning on the bottom of my feet making it feel like I'm walking on marbles. I typically wear a women's 8/12 or a European size  39.  In Crocs, I always  go a size 9 for the length.  I love both the Freesail and Classics and would urge anyone with ""touchy feet"" to give these a try.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first crocs.  I have avoided crocs because they are big clown shoes in appearance and I didn't want look like a ...you know.  I finally bought a pair because I am now swimming regularly and needed shoes that could get wet at the pool.  I hate flip flops, which abrade the tender area between big toe and second toe.  Well, I bought the crocs and they are awesome!  Very comfortable.  I have arthritis in my feet and the crocs are surprisingly supportive.  I wear them for long drives.  They are great at the dog park or in the back yard where I am likely to step in something that is very difficult to clean off sneakers but comes off easily with a hose or a wipe from my clogs.  Best of all, I look cool in them, and I know this because the younger generation is impressed.  Not the 20 somethings, who tend to roll their eyes, or my contemporaries who look askance and ask if I have been gardening but the stylesetters of tomorrow.  I wore them to the beach and a toddler and a four year old both patted my shoes. Now I want crocs in every color of the rainbow.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I LOVE THESE THINGS!! They're stylish and functional. These shoes are the future. It is not hard to pull them off with any outfit. Wear them to school, wear them to run errands, wear them to church! I sure do! Nothing can compare to these wonderful shoes.These shoes really show individuality. With a variety of colors and endless shoe charms, you can express who you are in a unique and fashionable way. Be a trend setter with Crocs, the shoes that should have never gone out of style!",5.0 out of 5 stars

We have been buying crocs for a long time and this time we received crocs that were marked the right size .... but one was significantly smaller and more narrow than the other. This was something we only realized after leaving on vacation. Our 12 year old constantly complained that the one was too small and the other was too large. He had to wear them until we could find a store to buy him flip flops and so we couldn't return them by the time we got back as they had been worn. Not sure what happened here but I have them and they are definitely two different sizes...,1.0 out of 5 stars
literally best purchase of my life. Everything went well was packaged very nicely. They looked great with my prom dress. I couldn't have asked for anything else,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this classic fit (wide) shoe in size 6 men to get a size 8 women's.  It fits perfectly.  Most comfortable shoe or clog ever.  They are also ugly but they are so ugly that they are cute. To be clear, I bought these to wear with fluffy socks so I have the room I need (my feet are not wide) when wearing the fluffy socks. The strap can be in the back or in the front.  I like having it across my heel when wearing socks.  Feet don't sweat thanks to all of the vents.  You can also put cute little Jibbitz on them that people will notice and take their attention away from the ugly shoes.  You can wear these things all day, 10-12 hours and your feet and legs will hold out.  I got the original classic style because so many people online complained about the soles coming apart on the newer style.  So buyer beware, if you try them you will love them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"What happened to the Crocs? I bought these as a relief to my feet after a day of hiking and camping.The sizing has changed considerably. The strap is 1 inch shorter than the actual shoe pushing and cramming your feet to the front of the shoe. Why Crocs, why was this design approved?  I bought two pairs, one for me, and one for my husband. The inside tread on my husband's pair was smooth and soft. The inside tread in mine were lifted and sharp like tiny needles. I could barely walk in them after a day's hike. These are the most uncomfortable pair of Crocs I have ever worn. I am very disappointed in the poor design and uncomfortable quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I ordered 2 pairs of these crocs classics, cerulean and pepper. Pepper is a true red (I was worried it might look pink) and the cerulean is very blue, not purple at all. I usually wear men's size 8.5 shoes and an m8/w10 fit when tried on in a store. However I read lots of reviews that said the sizes were very inconsistent. I need these soon so don't have time to mess with exchanges so I ordered m8/w10 and m9/w11. They were exactly the same size. Width, length, everything was the same, it was weird. I think they fit more like a m9/w11 but that's fine. I wanted/expected these to be pretty loose like my old ones from over a decade ago. These are pretty comfy like I remember and hopefully they last like my old ones did. I didn't find them shiny, uncomfortably small/narrow or the nubs inside to be too painful, which were all common complaints. Overall I say try them on in store first especially if you're in between sizes. I have high hopes for these. (These are the made in mexico ones by the way)",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I have worn Crocs for years, but the well-made ones that came from the USA (Colorado) many years ago.  These made in China ones are a harder plastic and extremely wide so that my feet slip around in them or the shoes fall off.  They also aren't anywhere near as comfortable due to the harder plastic, even if they did fit properly.  I have already started the return process, very disappointed since after many years, my American made ones are finally starting to wear out and need replacing",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was hoping these would fit like the Classic Clog Crocs I already have but, they still feel too small.  It's the third pair I've ordered lately and can't seem to find the fit I was hoping for.  Ended up donating these and the others to Value Village since I had worn them a couple of times.  None of them seemed as roomy as the ones I have almost worn out.  I love Crocs but am frustrated trying to find the right fit!",1.0 out of 5 stars

"These guys are amazing.  For years, I avoided them despite of the hype some time ago.  The funny thing is that I was always looking for a shoe that can work as a slipper because that would be so practical for traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Because of wide feet, I've been afraid of ordering these popular shoes.  Over the years I've had to return or give away shoes I carefully chose, cos only the front of my feet are wide (like a duck). Have to have some sort of strap, or tie on.  My siblings would urge me to try them, so I took the plunge. The 1st pair had to be returned because of a simply mistake at the factory; the wrong size was put in the box.  The replacement arrived yesterday, and I could turn cartwheels, if I could. So comfortable, roomy, and no breaking in period. With regular leather shoes, the little toe on my right foot is still squeezed; with the Crocs, no problem!  And it keeps my feet cool! These are officially my fav shoes. Plan to buy more in diff colors.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Never thought I'd buy a pair of crocs. I've been making fun of them for the past decade but when we moved into a new place with hard floors, I needed something to wear around the house. I stand/walk a lot at work and wanted something that was very comfortable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Where have these been all my life?  I first discovered a cheap copy of these at Walmart, and I loved how they fit and how easily they slip on and off.  So I was pleased to find the original brand here on Amazon.  I live in the desert, and our home is kept on the warm side too, so I definitely need models (like this classic model) with the holes in the side and top - the one thing I didn't like about my cheap knock-offs is they didn't have those holes, and my feet (with or without socks) were uncomfortably hot and clammy inside the house.  Another good feature is being able to toss the shoes into a bucket of soapy water to clean them after slogging in the mud outside.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are a cheap Crocs.  They have no arch support like the better Crocs do, the rubber is hard and not flexible and soft like other Crocs.  And they are much too large for a womens B width foot.  In fact, these Crocs actually hurt my feet and legs when I wore them out.  I will never wear these Crocs again.  In fact, I am taking them to Goodwill today and I just got them!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I never thought I would be writing a negative review for Crocs, as they have been my default footwear for many years. I have easily owned 6 pairs over the last 10 years, and I love them for many reasons......until this last pair. Actually I purchased 2 pairs, one black and one blue, as it never hurts to have another color for special occasions (although in this case, it does hurt). After wearing this most recent pair for 10 minutes, I realized my feet were feeling uncomfortable. Thinking a little break-in time might be needed (though that has never been the case before) I continued to wear them but after several hours I had to admit that my feet really did hurt. Upon further examination, I realized that these Crocs were about 1/2"" shorter than my old pair. I also noticed that the nubs on the inner sole that are molded into the Crocs were quite a bit sharper than I ever remembered from my older pairs. The appearance is identical with my older pair with the 2 exceptions mentioned above. Now, after repeatedly trying to wear them as my daily driver, I keep looking forward to taking them off after only a couple of hours. Perhaps they were molded from a different material that shrank, or that the forms for the molding process are smaller. Either way, I now have 2 pairs of Crocs that I don't want to wear. I wear size 12. Always have. Do I now have to move to a 13 (no half sizes) and risk them being too big? What I do know is that I am unhappy with my recent purchase.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This Crocs Men & Women's Classic Clog I received yesterday is the exact same as I have bought since they first came out. This one is NOT the same! Even the add/pic on here says they are made in Mexico. (My first clog was made in Boulder, the rest in Mexico.) The one I just ordered shows made in Vietnam. I noticed a diff as soon as I put it on. Much more of a hard plastic feel and a slightly smaller fit. I'm keeping them because it's to much trouble for me to return. I hope they wear ok. Time will tell. But this is FALSE advertising! I am starting to question Amazon's selling practices lately. But straight from Crocs website! It's worth the extra money to get the real thing.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Rare to find this brand at the Amazon price I paid - wanted a clog with heel strap so I could safely drive back & forth to the local aquatic center.  I wasn't excited about the glossy black appearance, but since I only wear them to drive from my garage to the pool, walk about 200 feet across hot concrete, stick them in a locker while I swim, then reverse the process to go home, I can overlook my own fashion faux pas.  The heel strap keeps them properly positioned on my feet while driving, and the drain holes in the toes make them great for poolside.  I have falling arches & these make the walk from car to poolside & back so much less painful than foam flip-flops - and as stated before, I feel confident driving my car (automatic transmission) whereas with flip-flops, I'd change in & out of socks & shoes, while my kids wait for me to get the car started & the A/C going.  If these last half as long as my old Crocs Mammoth clogs (10+ years so far & still have a little bit of tread on the soles), then these are the best deal in footwear for my Fashion Tone-Deaf Curmudgeon Community.

"I know, I know... they are the ""Given up on life"" shoe.  They are ugly as sin.  I know this.  But I also know that when I am in hour 16 of standing for the work I do, they are a lifesaver and I'm not thinking about my feet hurting.  I'm thinking about how much I doubt my career choice at that moment, but my feet are fine.  I'm thinking about crying as the sun is coming up and I still have another two or three hours to go, but my feet are good to go. And when I finally crawl into bed, every part of me is calling me names, but my feet are still my friend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This was my second attempt at getting a new pair of Crocs that fit. My shoe size is W6.5 so I bought the size W6 Crocs. When they arrived and I tried them on, they were too small. My toes were scrunched together and walking just a few steps was not comfortable at all. I returned them and ordered the next size up (W7), but they were still too small. I compared them next to the pair I currently have (size W6-7/S/M4-5, bought from a shop in Mexico) and you can immediately see the size difference (see attached photo). Haven't decided yet whether to go up the next 2 sizes or just go up 1 size at a time. I am able to return them for a full refund, so that's good. But seeing how much smaller they are, I might jump up to size 9 even though my shoe size has never been that big. If those fit me well, then I will change my rating to 5 stars, as I love my Crocs and wanted to replace them with ones I could wear outside (wore a hole through them that they are now inside shoes/slippers).",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I've had a pair of Croc knockoffs for at least a decade, and I'd worn them almost completely out. I wore them as slippers around the house, but they occasionally also became gardening clogs, shower shoes, etc. I got a pair of real Crocs to replace them, and the Crocs are definitely an improvement over the knockoffs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Crocs has apparently decided to save money on materials by shrinking the shoes. These are a full 1/2 inch shorter and 3/8 inch narrower than the same size ones they were intended to replace. I have returned them. I'm hesitant to order a larger size as they are also narrower, so I guess after 15 years of wearing them, I will have to find another shoe.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I never have liked the looks of these butt ugly things but my podiatrist told me to get a pair because of a foot problem.  They do offer great support and curiousness for my poor broken foot.  I find that when I walk my heel tends to extend over the inner sides and wants to roll in.  This is because I have such a high instep that my foot does not go all the way in.  I have about an inch of room in front of my big toe and my heel actually sticks out the back a little.  Perhaps I should have gone with a larger size?  The construction of these shoes is great and they are comfortable.  I expect that I will continue to wear these around the house once my foot has healed because of the support they offer.  I like them as slippers but not for walking any distance.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have two sets of Crocs I've been wearing for 10 years or so. I love them and they're all I wear, all year around. I've been needing a couple of more pairs to match outfits I have, so I ordered two pair (black and brown) last week. They're too small. They're the same size as the other two sets I have, but they're too small. I wear 8 wide, and the size 8 in the past has been perfect. Not this time. I can't return them because I wore them, so I'm hoping they give some over time. If I were to purchase them again, I'd get a size larger.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"For someone who has loved wearing the original crocs, these are not anywhere near the same.  They are almost an inch shorter than my others of the same size.  They are also narrower.  Worse, they are not as soft and cushie like walking on marshmallows the way the originals are.  Also, the finish is a cheap looking shiny texture rather than the mat finish they used to be.  I tried to wear them but can only stand them for an hour or two.  Thus, couldn't return them, but sure won't buy them again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"My chiropractor recommended wearing crocs since I started having plantar fasciitis problems. I usually wear woman's size 8 shoes, and got these in size 8. They seem a little big but it's actually more comfortable to wear that way, so I think these fit me perfectly. I like to life up the back holder part and wear them around like sandals. It's also nice when it's cold cause I can just slip them on with my socks on. As for dealing with my plantar fasciitis, it ended up working for me! I wore these every day, and at first I didn't notice that much of a difference and my feet ached in the morning for a while too, but around a year into wearing these, I have completely recovered from plantar fasciitis!! It's like I never even had plantar fasciitis before! I think it took a while for my feet to heal since it's something we use every day. Now I am able to wear normal flat sandals too and my feet are fine in the mornings. I still wear crocs and their brand sandals for my main footwear though, cause I think it helps to prevent plantar fasciitis from happening.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The product I received was not Crocs! I got some knock off brand called ""Satihu""  They looked just like Crocs and I didn't notice right away, but I started getting tendonitis pain in my left foot.  This is a recurring problem that is usually improved by wearing Crocs.  I took a closer look at the shoes and was shocked to see that they aren't real.  I went back and checked by order to make sure that the mistake wasn't mine, but the order clearly states that I purchased Crocs.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Crocs are crocs, right? I finally, after years, sprung for a pair of classic crocs. I am spending time on the farm, and these are great for gardening, checking on the horses & chickens etc. so easy to clean. And in this incessant rain (thanks Harvey) I need a waterproof shoe. Size wise.... I wish  they had half sizes. I wear 8.5, but ordered 8 as suggested. Maybe I have weird toes (I admit to have broken 2). Although the toe box is roomy, my 4th and 5th toes feel uncomfortably squished. I hope that, with time, the Crocs will mold to my feet. A size up is not an option, they would be floating on me. In short: I love the color (pepper, not too red but defnitely cheery!) and the functionality.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my first pair of crocs; never had the desire to own any. But now, can't imagine being without them! I needed something easy to slip into and take off when I'm down at the horse barn, feeding and cleaning corrals. Also nice that they are waterproof, unlike my old leather clogs. Excellent price, too . At first, I thought they were going to be floppy on my feet; I did purchase the size I usually wear. I wear socks with the crocs, sometimes two pair in the cooler months. They still fit just fine. I have narrow to medium width feet, wear a size 10. I like the orange because they're easy to spot wherever I've left them. Easy to clean off the dirt, either brush off or hose off; I understand they can be thrown in the washer, too. And, best of all, these crocs are as comfortable as my slippers I wear around the house. Sometimes, I forget I wore my crocs in the house, noticing sometimes hours later! Love them! And convinced my husband to order some, too! He loves his, too!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I hope so as I ordered a white pair in 9 from Crocs.com too as I was so sure after trying on my friend's size 8's. We both agreed to order one size up for me.

"I was so excited to get the cyan blue crocs on super sale. These are the comfiest shoes ever. The dots on the soles massage your feet, they provide great arch support, they’re such a cute color, and it’s finally long enough past the initial croc trend that they’re ironically stylish again. 10/10 recommend for beach days, days at the pool, rainy days, regular days, lazy days, winter days with socks, or whatever else to want to wear them with. They definitely run large, so try on a friend’s or try them on in the store first if possible. But snag yourself a pair, you won’t regret it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I purchased these as a replacement for a pair of first generation crocs that were marked size 8-9.  I wear a size 9M American, size 42 Euro, and after reviewing the fit reviews and Croc's sizing chart, I ordered size 9.  The new size 9 crocs are much too big.  While the length was okay, the width was much too wide.  I returned the size 9s and re-ordered a pair of size 8s which are much closer in fit to my original pair but the heels are wider than the originals.  I've attached a photo of the size 9s on the left, size 8 in the middle, and the original size 8-9 on the right.  Note the width of the heels and the overall shape.  The originals fit (me) much better.  The 8s will have to do.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Ordered a W8. This is my first pair of Crocs & I’m not sure whyyyyyy I waited this long to get a pair. Now I see why ppl use it. Very comfortable. I’m flat footed. I was able to wear it barefoot & also w| thin socks (tester around the house). The strap part to keep your feet in, it’s actually shorter than the actual length of the shoe (it’s not lined up with the heel part . Around a quarter of an inch or so from the heel) so when it goes around the back of your foot, it actually pushes your feel more inside the shoe. This isn’t a big deal for me as I’m actually a 7.5 women’s. I always love ordering any shoe item a half size bigger to have the extra room for thicker socks if needed. My Crocs were made in Mexico. I’ve seen some complaints about sizing issues when it’s made in different countries. Anyways, I would recommend a pair to anyone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have a pair of original Crocs that I bought 15 years ago and absolutely love them.  But the soles finally wore through and I needed to finally get another pair.  The size stamped on the bottom says W6-7.  I started looking on Amazon and couldn't believe how many styles of Crocs there are.  All I wanted was another pair just like my old ones.  I saw these Crocs Unisex Classic Clog and they looked almost identical to what I have.  I got a size 7 in Pepper and they are perfect.  I plan on ordering a couple more pairs.

I’m using the shoes as houseshoes because we have all tile and as I’ve aged I’ve developed feet issues from the shoes we wear. I researched the toe shoes and zero drop shoes and since I don’t have access to a store near me Crocs Classics were recommended so I bought these despite some Amazon reviews regarding size difference. Mine came from Vietnam and they fit fine. I recently purchased another pair for the street and the back strap on left foot is slightly shorter than right but after walking a couple of days in them I have gotten use to them. My shoes were made in Bietnam. I think perhaps there are some quality differences depending on where the shoes are manufactured so Cros needs to look at there quality control closer I think. I love the crocs classics and have no foot pain while wearing them.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"5 stars for the product, 0 stars for the idiotic sizing.  You'd think they'd fix it with all the complaints.  Bought my first Crocs at a yardsale and they're wearing out so I ordered these which I believed to be the same thing, but they're absolutely not.  The bottoms of my old ones say ""W10-11  M8-9"".  These are ""M9 W11"" and the shoe is so big my foot is just rattling around in there.  They're going back, but I honestly don't know what size to order now.  My advice is to never buy shoes or hats on-line without free returns, and even then don't do it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these shoes! Crocs are silly looking yes, but that is what I love about them! I'm writing this review mainly just to note that in the description, it advises that if you're a half size to go a size down, since crocs can be large fitting/wide. However, this wasn't the case for me. I'm a size 7 and 1/2 in womens, so I chose a size 7, but I had to return it as I found it too tight fitting. If you fit size 8 converse just fine, then you most likely have feet similar to mine, so I'd recommend going a size up! Even without socks, it was uncomfortable enough for me to have to return it for a larger size.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have seen people wearing these for years and always thought they look ridiculous and couldn’t imagine how foam rubber shoes could be comfortable or durable. It’s obvious they aren’t stylish. After buying my very first pair of grass green size 15 crocs here for a crazy pre Christmas sale price of under 10$ with the free prime shipping, I’m amazed. After trying them on I no longer care how they look and I now get why they are popular. They are light durable and super comfy without feeling like you’re walking on marshmallows. In fact I was shocked how firm the foot bed is without being hard. I no longer care how they look. Not sure I would wear them to a wedding but for around the house and yard they are perfect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I was going to buy slippers to wear in my yard and patio since it's been annoying to put shoes on whenever taking my dog outside or to take the trash out.

"I bought 2 pair of crocs in two different colors. I wear size 6 1/2 shoes and the crocs are a size 7. They just barely fit, they are almost too small. I have a pair of crocs, this exact size, bought about ten years ago, and they are about a half inch longer and a bit wider. I was hoping the pairs I bought would be that exact size. The old pair says ""Made in China"" and the new pairs say ""Made in Vietnam"" and ""Made in Mexico"". I'm happy with the looks and quality of the new crocs, just wish they were a tad larger, more like a size 7. In the photos, the shoe on the left is the new croc, the shoe on the right is my old croc.

"I bought these specifically for my rowing club needs. I needed something waterproof, easy to get on & off quickly, and the ability to stuff my foot into while wearing bulky wool socks (and, as I encountered the other day, the ability to actually float). They do provide for all of these needs. The fit, however, is a little weird. I'm a pretty solid Women's 7, with a fairly wide foot. The width is fine, but my toes hit the end of the shoe pretty aggressively without socks, and the toe grip thingy on the sole seems oddly placed.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"These a very light, which was unexpected. I thought they would be like the old, heavy, rubber ones, but these seem to be silicone-based and are pleasantly light, bendable and comfortable. They are good for letting the errant water flow through during gardening, but of course, the open side holes also allow lots of dirt to get in, which is not as easy to get out without taking them off. That said, how hard is it to take them off? They do what they are supposed to.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"You expect good quality control from a brand name like Crocs so it’s disappointing to get one with obvious defects. The strap on the left slipper is bent out of round, so it’s not comfortable to wear. I tried stretching it over the back of the slipper overnight to get it back in shape, but it didn’t help. It seems something went wrong in the molding process. I bought this on sale on Black Friday so maybe they were unloading second quality items during this sale, or I just got a bad one. The question is whether I want to go through the hassle of shipping this back to exchange it on Amazon!  It’s a disappointing to have to go through this on a simple order.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Par excellence Crocs. These fit nice and are comfy. This is my third pair which I bought because the Croc company is off-shoring it's production and well you know how re-sellers are. I mean who is going to pay $400 for a pair of Crocs.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for a trip to wear on the beach.  They are comfy and fit okay but I have to get used to the large fit. I was initially ready to return them after trying them on and seeing that they fit rather loosely. I have a noticeable gap between my heel and the strap if I move my foot forward to wear my toes touch the front.  However,  Crocs classic clogs are in the ""roomy fit"" line of Crocs which, according to the Crocs website means they should be roomy with feet never touching the sides and front.  My fit matches the description exactly but it takes a little getting used to because I've never worn a shoe so roomy.  Fit aside, they do feel comfortable and the sole is soft and more comfy than flats or sandals.  If you absolutely do not want a roomy fit, I'd suggest ordering a size smaller. I think an 11 would fit me just right despite wearing a size 12 sneak and size 13 shoe depending on design.  I'm keeping mine though because the fit is exactly as Crocs describes it should be.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I've  been wearing the same brand/style for many years -- the Crocs classic. This time when I ordered new ones of the same size as always before, they are smaller. Size 8 (women's) were always just a tad too large, which was perfect because they stayed on well while giving my feet room to expand when they get swollen. My toes rub the font of the shoe a little in the new ones. By this measurement, I need an 8.5, but that is not offered, at least not in Amazon.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I couldn't find the classic ones in the stores around where I live anymore. They all have adopted the newer hard bottoms. I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers. Just for some context, I'm Asian, and we don't wear shoes into the house. Partially to keep the floors clean, but probably some other cultural reason that I haven't looked into yet. We have specific indoor slippers. I haven't looked too much into slippers, but I know these are good in the winter time because they can keep my feet warm and are easy to wash if they start to smell.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They measured at least 13.75"" toe box to heel. If you have a hard time finding exact fits in Woolly Monmouth sizes, I would find a way to test fit these before you try them, as they are not sized the same as many main brand shoes. The quality of the product overall though is second to none. The foam is rigid but soft and the shoes feel plenty durable for a camp shoe or a water fording option when backpacking. Amazon, as always, was fantastic in allowing me to exchange them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had a pair like this for years.  I got paint on them so decided to finally buy a new pair - all shiny and new.  I was shocked at how small they seemed.  I compared them to my old crocs - same size - and the bottom of the croc is the same.  The problem is that the back strap is much shorter than the old crocs so it pushes your foot into the front of the croc - very uncomfortable.  They're unwearable. Unfortunately I tried to wear them because I couldn't believe they wouldn't fit like the old ones and thought they'd ""mold/stretch"" to fit so I can't return them.  Very disappointing - not sure I'll ever buy crocs again. I don't know if this was a quality fluke or if that's the way they all are now.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"These are the old original Crocs they've been selling for many years now. It was about 4-5years ago when they started making some newer Crocs with a newer type of plastic, I've bought a few pairs of those and they've all had problems with shrinking, which eventually causes them to rub and blister your foot in different places, to be expected when you buy shoes that fit, which then proceed to shrink! Don't know why they sell those ones, the material is clearly defective imo. These originals might wear out a little quicker but they're comfortable and don't shrink.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These were meant to be worn in the isolation of the trail, never to be seen in society. My secret is out. Nobody thinks I'm cool anymore. But my feet sure are nice and comfy at camp. Guess I'll have to live in the woods forever with my crocs, because now I don't have any friends left. Thanks, amazon.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought my first pair of Crocs almost ten years ago, back when they were made in Colorado.  They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time.  My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there.  Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it.  These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it.  They aren't very cushioned.  They are also a lot smaller.  They fit but just barely.  Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.)  Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside.  They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others.  You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs.  I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time.  I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting.  Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for.  They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs.  Not sure if it's because of the smaller size or the new material.  Overall, I'm very unhappy with these shoes.  Looks like I'll have to find a replacement for my old Crocs elsewhere.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"One of my sons had a neat pair of some inexpensive rubbery shoes and I asked him to get me a pair. Dissatisfied with them I bought myself some Crocs instead. Thinking I'd have them by the front door to slip on when I got the mail or took out the trash, which usually mean walking out in the rain, and the Crocs were a decent no slip foot gear.

The Crocs were very important, heck, are still important in getting to my medical appointments during recovery!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I originally purchased these for my girlfriend for Christmas. We use Crocs to go kayaking in since they're rubber and clearly don't hold water. The only downside to using these for something like kayaking is that when the surface you're stepping on is slick, don't expect Crocs to have a firm grip - they'll make you slip easily (only downside but not enough to give 4/5 stars). We also wear crocs to go out in the spring time when the yard is just mud. That way, we can just hose the crocs off and our feet off before we go back in the house.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Roomy enough to wear with even heavier socks or just barefoot with no affect on how well they stay on. I always wear mine without the heel strap. When these do wear out, I will buy another pair of Crocs! The hardest decision will be picking a color as there's many choices that I really like.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Believe what you hear about the size being too small. These particular Crocs were manufactured in Italy--why does that matter? Italians are known to have smaller/narrower feet than Americans. Honestly, even with the narrowed width, they still supplied the known comfort of Crocs, the biggest problem of limited length is attributed to the straps not protruding back enough to allow the foot the space you get when wearing the Crocs without the use of the straps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these Crocs in the very nice light grey.  I almost returned these shoes because the nibs on the footbed felt sharp and prickly and hurt the bottom of my feet.  I used a while 3M abrasive pad to rub down the nubs and I am now happy with the feel.  I have a men's10.5 EEE foot and the size 11 M Crocs fit me pretty well.  3 stars instead of 5 because of the nuns being too sharp.  Otherwise a good looking a comfortable shoe.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I call them my new Bozo the Clown shoe because they are so wide, but I wear an 8.5, and the 6 -8 fits perfectly.  I just ordered another pair that may be less wide.  I cannot wait!

Purchased my first pair at an Outlet Mall about 5 years ago and paid almost twice the amount for the same thing.  I used to wear them around the house inside and out.  They finally needed replaced after a small hole got worn into the sole.  They held up very well for a long time.  Probably should have been replaced a year ago but even 4 years of wear and tear is pretty good for rubber shoes.  These new ones fit just like the old ones.  The only noticeable difference is the back heel portion is a bit shorter than my original pair.  Excellent Product.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Lots of air flow to keep my feet cool, but still a closed toe shoe that is required in my medical office job. I bought a 9 US Womens, I usually wear a 8.5 (39 euro size) but my feet have definitely changed during this second pregnancy.

The new design of the insole where your feet rest are full of little spikes molded into the shoe itself.  Perhaps my feet are very soft and sensitive, but I can’t wear these without some sort of insert; I certainly had no intention of wearing these with socks!  Those little spikes hurt my feet!  That’ll pretty much eliminate wearing them in water, which is one of my primary uses for these.  I’ll try to find a suitable insert, but I may just have to return these.

They're some of the more comfortable sandals I own, since they have some arch support and whatnot in them.

Overall love the design, there is a bit of arch support which I want, very comfortable. I wear these as ""house slippers"" all the time I'm in the house, I live on a farm and wear boots most of the time outside, so out in the garage I leave these while stepping into my boots, and vice versa. I probably wouldn't wear these out anywhere, but you certainly could. I don't use the straps, just leave them in the out of the way position, forward, but if I did wear them any place but in the house I'd probably engage those straps.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Based on a previously purchased pair similar (but without backstrap) that were a bit snug at the end of the day or on ""swollen feet"" days, I purchased this, only one size larger. Mistake.  I am SWIMMING in these. I might try them in the fall with socks, but that defeats the purpose of easy rinse off with hose through the holes.  Moreover, since most gardening is done with water, I'll be left with wet, dirty socks each time.  Beware of the difference between ladies', men's, and unisex products.  My former purchase must have been a ladies' shoe (didn't buy online, and there's no indication inside or underneath shoe, just a size number), and these are unisex.  Bottomline, if basing new purchase size on a current pair of shoes, know that unisex is like TWO sizes larger than a current ladies' size.  It would be nice, also, if Crocs would 1.) consider labeling the bottom of their shoes with an L, U, or MN (not just M, or people might think ""medium"" who didn't know better) before the size number (for ladies, uni, or men) so that  future customers (and current! esp. if received as a gift) know what they own, and equally important, 2.) state how to convert various gender sizing with ordering similar or same shoes--example ""Order same size if you want a slightly larger fit, when going from ladies' to unisex.""",2.0 out of 5 stars

It took a while, but I finally decided that I needed to buy a pair of my own. My feet hurt all the time, especially my heels because that's where I put all of my weight when standing. Let me tell you: I can walk around for hours wearing these shoes, and I don't feel any discomfort. Even after a 9-hour shift of standing and walking around at work, I can put these on, and my feet already feel better. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a pair.

I am picky about my footwear, and there are few things I can wear without the soles of my feet hurting. These things are SO comfortable! They are super lightweight and seriously the only footwear I needed for the entire week on the cruise. I wore them in the room, walking around the ship, walking around ports, to the beach, to the pool, and even to dinner. The last is maybe not recommended, but you can definitely get away with it. :) I even tried to continue wearing them once I got back to the Minnesota snow (although that did not work out so well). I like the black color because they blend in a little bit more than the brighter colors. They do get crease marks on the top of them, but there's not really a way to prevent that.

Crocs dry very quickly because they don't absorb water as many neoprene water shoes do.

After a week or so of going barefoot and not wearing them I ended up with a full limp and a sore knee (from walking funny because of my foot pain).  My husband couldn't stand it anymore and told me to order another pair PRONTO!  I did, and within a day my feet felt great again!  I have incredibly high arches, and these are one of the few types of shoes I can wear for extended periods of time without any pain.  I loooove my crocs!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I know people think crocs are now longer cool, I do not care!  I love crocs, especially in the summer.  They super great at the pool and wash out really well.  I love to take them camping.  I think of them as my camping slippers.  Super Awesome when nature calls in the middle of the night.  When you have more than one color, go ahead and mix and match!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Liked the free return-The first pair was a size too small, the Clogs I ordered as a replacement fit perfectly. A comfortable size for me turned out to be 1/2 size larger than the fit I like for a shoe. When first wearing I thought the loose fit would be a problem with the Clogs slipping off as the back strap is not adjustable but due to good design by Crocs the Clogs are completely secure and do not slip off. My advice is to go for the loose fit as it makes for a very comfortable fit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have worn these since I got my first pair for 50¢ at a garage sale! The price on Amazon was not quite that good, but it was on the low side. I did have to return mine though because my size was not available in my desired color of khaki. Zappos had them (free shipping and free returns). As always, Amazon is my first choice, but even having to pay $6 more on Zappos.com I got the color I needed. Crocs sizing can be confusing: the bottom of each shoe list two sizes:  M (men) W (women). So when looking for your size, look for your gender size. The shoes should fit roomy at the toe and at the heal - do not let them rub anywhere (as advised by crocs). You will get used to the loose fit after a while - or just use the back strap for more stability. I ordered M 8/ W6 and it was to small (short: toe & heal touched ends) My normal shoe size is women's 8 and on rare occasion 8 1/2. My foot is narrow to med. width. The size I needed from crocs was M7/W9 (so the women's 8 was too small/short). Amazon showed my size of US7/9 (way down at the bottom of the scroll down drop-list), but did not have my color available. Thought I'd take a chance (to save $6) and try women's 8. Zappos, like Amazon, delivered quickly and the shoes in the proper size 7/9 fit!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"To be honest, I really wanted the Purple Classic Crocs to replace an older, worn-out pair, but I wasn't about to pay three times the price just to have that same color of Crocs. I have no idea why the pricing is so varied depending on the color you select, but I am happy to say that these hot pink, ""Neon Magenta"" Crocs are working out just fine. The fit is perfect and true to size, and the same quality and comfort is there, too. Plus, they barely put a dent in my pocketbook. I still miss my purple Crocs and will continue to monitor them here on Amazon. I just hope they are soon offered at a reasonable price. They must be an extremely popular color choice if people are willing to pay $60.00 right now just to have purple feet! (I must have started something years ago when I purchased my original pair...)",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have two sets of Crocs I've been wearing for about 10 years and they've been great. They're the only shoes I wear, year around. I love them. Or I did. Recently, I ordered two new sets (black and brown) and they're too small. Very small. They're the same size as the two sets I've been wearing, but they don't fit the same. I wear a size 8 wide and the Crocs size 8 has been perfect. Unfortunately, I've worn them so I can't return them, but if I were to purchase more I'd get a size larger. I hope as I wear these two, they'll loosen up.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my third pair of actual Crocs. The other two pair were a women's flats in two different colors, and I love them, but at my age, I need a little more padding for long shopping trips. So I got these classic Crocs. The Navy color is perfect, and true to the image shown. I ordinarily wear a 7 1/2 M and followed the advice to order the next full size down, so a 7M, and they fit very well except for one issue that might only apply to someone like me who has a long second toe and who wears a size 7M. There are holes at the base of the front around the edge, as clearly seen in the photo. The holes on both the left and right shoe line up in such a way that my second toe ends up sticking out of the hole. This is less than optimal. The shoes are otherwise very comfortable and have plenty of padding. I wore them on a recent shopping trip, and except for the issue of the toes sticking out, were just what the doctor ordered. I wore ankle socks to see if that would stop the toe from poking out, but it didn't. I did have to subtract one star from the rating, because of the toe issue, and I'm open to suggestions on what might be done to plug up those holes so my toes don't poke through. I want to keep the shoes, because I was far less fatigued after the shopping trip than usual, but my second toes were a little sore on the sides where they rubbed the shoe after poking out. I don't think one of those decorative plugs they have would work, because they would take up too much room on the inside of the shoe.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Let's face it. Crocs are ugly. Having said that, I bought these and wear them constantly - they are like walking barefoot with rubber bumpers. I had to re-learn my natural gait after hip replacement last year and Crocs were my go-to shoe during that time. I've recommended Crocs to friends having knee surgery for the same reason. These classic style black Crocs are the same size as purple classics I've had for years but these fit the way shoes should - I didn't realize how loose and big the older pair were. I believe they were manufactured in different countries which seems to make a difference in sizing. Go Crocs!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first pair of crocs after years of making fun of people who wear these shoes. I wanted a pair of shoes I could slip on and off quickly for letting the dogs, taking the trash out, etc. so I decided to give them a try since they are so affordable. I love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not the ""same ol' thing"" that I was hoping for.  The material is NOT the cushy comfortable foam that I had hoped for - it is much less rubber-y and much more plastic-y than the old ones and the sizing is also way off.  In comparing the two, the new ones are about a half inch shorter in total length than my old ones of the same size.  I had another pair that I purchased about a year ago--same problem, but gave them away in hopes it was a fluke batch. Apparently not and I have returned the shoes and am searching for a replacement--anyone know of any OLD stock Crocs for sale?",2.0 out of 5 stars
"The baby blue color was pretty. I bought it in size 9B (W)/ 7 B(M). My daughter wears a size 7.5-8.0, and I am a size 8.5-9.0. The shoe was too long by a thumb and a quarter length for me and even longer for my daughter. I based the purchase on an older croc that was labeled 8-9 and which fit her just fine but touched my toe. I tend to like to purchase a half size up, so I ordered the 9. Because the length was too long, the ankle strap was useless. The width was too wide for my medium width feet and extra wide for my daughter's narrow feet. If you are a size 8.5-9.0 like me, I'd order a size 8. But beware that the width will still be big in general and especially for folks with narrow feet. The little nubs in the shoe were more pronounced in the toe area and hardly felt in the other areas of the shoe. I have flat feet, and the shoe did not have any arch support which works fine for me since my feet tend to hurt when shoes have significant arch support.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these for me and my husband to walk the dog, and we absolutely love them!  They are super lightweight, provide perfect stability and comfort, and you can stick them under a garden hose and they look brand new.  Honestly never had crocs before, but these are truly something spectacular.  I like the look of them, my husband thinks they are ugly, yet he wears them everywhere so that must tell you something about how comfortable they are :)  We have not had them for very long yet so I cannot speak on the durability and longevity of these shoes, but I will definitely be back to update.  Thank you!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I can't believe I waited this long in life to finally muster up enough courage to buy these and wear them in public, but it's the best and most comfortable decision I ever made! They arrived on time, color matched to a T, and they're the most pleasant shoes to wear that I own! I can wear these all day and sometimes even forget they're on, save for the bright color I ordered. I will definitely recommend and even buy them as presents in the future! I also recently discovered they make charms for them now...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have a slightly wide foot, size 8 men's, and they fit comfortably in the size 8 US Men's Classic Clog (the standard size, not wider model). It's roomy, but not to the point where my foot flops around feels insecure, and there's enough room to wear the clogs with socks on. I like that they're easy to slip on and off and have good traction on wet surfaces. So now I just have to see how they'll do over time. They're replacing a pair of sandals that I bought in Hawaii thirty years ago and are still wearable, but I like the fact that the Crocs have a little more toe protection.",5.0 out of 5 stars
If you've never owned crocs before I really highly recommend them. Don't get me wrong I do not wear these to work or to social events. I don't buy them because they're cute. I buy them because they're practical. I can wear them in the river or when I'm gardening. They also are great to take hiking in case you don't want to jam your feet into your tennis shoes when you have to get up and out of your tent in the middle of the night. I imagine if I lived on a beach I'd wear them there too. They are super easy to clean and I honestly could wear them for days on end I think they're so comfortable.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"DO NOT buy these crocs if you are looking for the real deal, they are huge and the holes are the wrong size/ in the wrong places.

I've purchased cheap knockoffs that cost almost as much as these, and they werent half as good. I've worn these every day and the soles dont show any wear. More importantly, they are soft and comfortable, while the knockoffs are stiff and uncomfortable.

"I used to have heel pain --  plantar fascia.  I stretched a couple times a day and that mostly kept the pain at bay.  Then a friend suggested crocs.  Pain gone.  It has been 10 years since I have worn anything else -- or stretched.  I used to these shoes direct from Crocs.  The website is nice and there are all kinds of options.  Almost all of the styles that I tried were narrower.  My 'real shoe' size is 11 EEE.  Crocs Mens 12 work in this style.  If they feel a little tight at first, keep wearing them.  They stretch and, like fine leather shoes, mold to the feet.  Amazon Prime means free shipping, so I can buy one pair at a time without paying shipping and for the same price as the Crocs website or the local box store.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love Crocs especially after breaking a bone in my foot. These have the extra space I need for my wide feet so that they don't hurt that sensitive part of my foot. Even with thick socks, these are the most comfortable shoes I own. The cushiony sole has always been a positive, as well as the deep tread for traction even on a wet sidewalk. If they're a bit loose in bare feet, the strap helps hold them on without worry. The ultraviolet color could be called grape, a lovely shade of purple.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I work for an FDA controlled facility, so street shoes are not allowed on the floor and work shoes are not allowed off the floor. I bought these to keep at work so I can walk around in the non-production areas without having to put my street shoes back on every time. They're fine, they're just about one whole size larger than my regular street shoes (Asics and New Balance) which makes them awkward to wear. I might spring for another pair for beach shoes, as they do slip on and off nicely and they're comfortable to walk in.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I was hesitant to buy these for a couple of reasons.  First, they're...you know--rubber? Plastic? Something like that...  Second, they're...you know--not masculine? Kind of sissified? Finally, the picture makes them look flimsy. So okay. Yes--they are some kind of man-made rubber/plastic/neoprene/something, but that makes them waterproof meaning you can leave them out on the deck after you've been working in the yard and you don't have to worry about them getting soggy and ruined. No--they're not the most masculine shoes I've ever seen, so you have to be pretty confident in your manhood if you wear them out on the town but I got them for yard work which is a fairly macho enterprise. And no, they're not as flimsy as the pictures look. I don't know how long that heel-strap thing will last, but I don't use it half the time anyway and for some reason, your feet don't slip out of the shoes without it, so if it does break--Super Glue and duct tape. THEN they'll look masculine!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I've never tried Crocs until last week. Always wore thong sandals out around the house, when I was too lazy to put on real shoes/sandals. These are easy to slide into...are pretty darn comfortable...fit is good! I wear an 11EE shoe, with a high instep. My foot actually measures 10.5, but 11 fits better. I would say this fits true to size (unisex mens 11). I probably have 1/2"" of space at the heel....which is fine. Plenty of room in the shoe. Came in a Croc bag with their tags on the shoe....so they seem to be authentic. I would recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I was the guy saying ""No! Never doing Crocks!"" I will tell you man I love those things! They are so comfortable and great for camping and trips.

Don't get me wrong, Flip-Flops have a huge place in my heart but I just took my crocks on a 7700 mile motorcycle camping trip and I was so happy I had them. They were a great component to what I needed to be comfortable. Just give them a try but just don't start wearing them to work. Just not acceptable..",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I wore these at least once a day for 9 months on my last military deployment. I highly recommend them if you need ""shower shoes."" I wore these in the shower, in my berthing, and even walking through the Kuwaiti desert to get to the bathroom. They've been folded, smushed, and packed multiple times in my pack and they don't seem to show any signs of breaking. One thing a lot of people might not realize is that they're thicker than regular flip flops and will protect your feet from bacteria better. I seriously think everyone should use these instead of those cheap, black $1 flip flops you get at the PX. I wear a size 11 in most footwear, but these were maybe a half size too big. I didn't really mind this because they were easy to slip on and off.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these shoes for work. Let me start by saying that these are the first pair of Crocs that I've ever owned. They were delivered right on time and I was anxious to put them on. I can't lie, I was a little put off by the appearance. Big, bulky, clownish looking shoes. That all went away by the time I put them on my feet. It felt as though I was walking on water. I usually come home limping from work from standing on my feet for 8 hours, but these give me just enough support and cushion to where my feet feel fine after a long days work. They are also a breeze to clean. My feet sweat heavily and this was a major problem when wearing sneakers. I could never quite get the smell out of them. With Crocs, all it takes is a wet cleaning wipe and these babies are like brand new. They are surprisingly lightweight, comfortable, and I'm even starting to like the way they look (lol) I plan on buying more in different colors in the near future.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"It's about the ease of donning & doffing and general comfort. It's not about any aesthetic appeal, which it is perhaps not particularly high on. I found my first pair (of the original Crocs--new in box) while dumpster diving several years ago. I brought them home to show my wife just how absurd a pair of shoes can look. For a lark, I tried them on and--what do you know? Those goofy-looking shoes were extremely comfortable! I have worn them near daily ever since. Interestingly, after they started getting popular and appearing on lots of other people's feet, they stopped looking quite so goofy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My orthopedist diagnosed me with a severely bruised heel bone and nothing he told me to try was working.  Crocs work.  I have 3 pairs of them now and they're the only shoes I can stand to wear at the moment, but they're actually letting my heel bone heal up unlike everything else I'd been trying.  Yay for Crocs!  I still think they're ugly as homemade sin and they make my feet sweat and stink, but at least my heel is getting better!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"When in doubt, I went with the loudest possible color I could find for these. They are a bright pink! These are unattractive in my opinion, but comfortable. They're slowly growing on me. I like the adjustable strap so you can wear it as a mule as well. I used the ""custom"" size helper and it suggested a nine. They are about a half size too big. My toes can wiggle freely in the top with a medium-thin/thick sock on. I may order another pair in the 8 women's. I have read that there is a difference in sizing if it is made in Mexico or China. Mine state ""made in Italy"", so I guess that's another place these are manufactured, if this helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"These are what you expect; waterproof, easy to clean and pretty darn comfortable. Great for yard work, gardening and for slipping on and off when you need quick foot ware.

"... and counting.  Years ago, when I got my first pair of Crocs, I was dubious and totally unconvinced they'd live up to expectations.  Boy, was I mistaken!  Today, I have a pair of originals for warm-weather outdoor use, and another no-holes, fuzzy-lined pair for cold-weather outdoor use.  These are replacements for a worn-out indoor-only pair.  Crocs have essentially become my go-to house slipper and, used with a pair of plush socks, provide daylong comfort.  The arch support is superb and when I'm at the workbench, standing on a bare, concrete floor, my feet are happy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
This really was a bummer. The sizing isn't consistent. I had purchased other Crocs with the Classic clog fit and fit well. This pair ran small and the straps did look a little short that it made my feet roll to the tips of the clogs. I had a much better experience with the Crocs Unisex Specialist Vent Clog. They have a more relaxed fit and the straps neither too short or long.,2.0 out of 5 stars

I bought a pair at my wife's urging because I have some foot problems...achy feet, plantar fasciitis, etc. The Crocs are incredibly comfortable to wear and bring immediate comfort and relief when I wear them. I have them next to my bed and slip them on first thing in the morning. I normally wear a size 13...when I get another pair I will be getting them in a size 12. The 13's are a little long and wide...not a problem, but I think I'll go one size smaller next time (and there WILL be a next time!)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these and wear them a lot. They have the typical Croc roomy fit which feels almost like you're barefoot.  You think that they would come off your foot when you walk but they don't.  They feel sort of gel-like on your feet with their cushiony rubber. I really like the option of using the heel strap or flipping it up so you can slip in and out of them easily, like slippers.  You get used to their quirky appearance, if not, get one of the more traditional looking models. I have three different styles which I wear exclusively as casual shoes.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I had always thought Crocs were rather unattractive shoes and didn't understand how and why people would wear them. Then I retired, bought a power washer, and badly needed some outdoor shoes that could handle the water and still give me the traction to push the mower. (I did NOT want to get my nice athletic shoes all wet and green from the grass.) A shoe store associate directed me to the Croc. I knew the Croc was a wider shoe and only came in whole sizes. So I ordered an 8 even though I wear an 8.5. This shoe fit my wide feet perfectly and was very comfortable. I love, love, love that I don't have to worry about getting dirt, water, soap, grass stains, etc. on these shoes because I can just wash them off with the hose. In the meantime, my athletic shoes stay in pristine condition. THEN, I started wearing the Crocs around the house while cleaning and running up and down the stairs doing laundry. I am even considering wearing them when I run to the grocery store or gym!! Another bonus is that these shoes come in a variety of attractive colors,",5.0 out of 5 stars
"There's something about these Crocs that are just different than the pair I had a few years ago. It might be the little knobs in the footbed or something, but they're just not as comfortable out of the package like my first pair. Plus, they're just slightly more narrow. Not so much that it's a problem, and they do give more with time, but it's noticeable. At least to me. I'd probably give this more like 3.5/5 than a 3. I'll kick around in them every now and again I'm sure.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Finally gave in, and I love them -- I have resisted crocs for many years, because they look, to be brutal, stupid.  But we spend the winter on the beach, and I got tired of ruining at least two pairs of white sandals a year by getting them wet when I was totally sure I wouldn't.  So: crocs.  The reviews left me frightened of mis-sizing, so I shot an arrow in the air and ordered an eight, which fits perfectly.  They are comfortable on the beach, comfortable around the house, and comfortable when we go out on errands.  Mine are white, and they have stayed dazzlingly clean looking.  On the downside, they do accumulate debris, and the do look -- stupid.  But noone is asking me to wear them on Madison Avenue, and for a beach community, they are just great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have wide feet, tall feet, and have a heel lift I wear in my left shoe (which creates its own shoe criteria). I need slip resistant ventilated shoes. These classic crocs fit the bill. I will always be wearing these with socks. They are wide enough for my feet, tall enough for my instep (even with the heel lift) and are quite comfortable to wear all shift. These are not fashion shoes and I don't expect them to be that, but for all the rest of the times, these will be the shoes I wear. My only caution would be that these shoes have little cushion. The rubber does have some give but it is not the same as a well padded shoe. For me this is acceptable because they don't hurt my feet to wear. Other's may find that to be a turn off.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"The first pair had the heel loop come off. The plastic part which secures the loop to the shoe came off. Luckily this was after just 5 minutes. Check this part first before wearing it outside. Other than that the second pair arrived and seems to work well. This are my first Crocs so we will see how much I like them as time goes by. Note - I usually wear a Wide shoe and the 11 M seem a bit tight when I wear socks. The similar Crocs offered on the Crocs website say that they are roomy, but I beg to differ and these same shoes don't seem to be.You might try a larger size if you have a wide foot. Note - if I don't wear socks the Crocs are fine - so I guess it depends on how you are going to wear these. If you plan to wear them with socks, get a larger size. On the beach, these would be perfect for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I find Crocs clogs so comfortable for anytime when I'm doing a lot of walking.  The only complaint I've had with Crocs is the inconsistency of the sizing.

I have always had large feet for a woman (10/10.5), so I really don’t like shoes that emphasize the fact that I am walking around with feet that could double as water skis at a moment’s notice.

I didn't have any crocs at the time so I had to walk with my bare feet if I wanted to go in. They also made great camping shoes when setting up camp and just relaxing.

"The shoes themselves are fine hence the 3 stars BUT I started with a black pair of size 11 taking a gamble because I wear an 11.5 in all my shoes. They were so large they looked like 13's on my feet. So I thought okay I will return these and get a size 10 which at the time was not available in black just in orange (for colors I liked) so I got them today and my foot barely fits in the shoe my toes are jammed into the front rendering them unwearable. So back they go, not trying a third time.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So easy.  I have a 3-year old and a 4-year old.  They are crocs, so they are not stylish.  But I often find myself getting the kids ready to go, and then one wants to be picked up after I have them ready and before I can put my shoes on.  That guarantees I'm wearing the crocs, as they just slide on so easily and therefore I can just step into them while holding one or two children, which I couldn't do with sneakers.  Extremely comfortable, and just wear them out of necessity.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these for my husband to use while moving irrigation pipes in tall grass fields.  The seeds don't stick to them like they did to his regular shoes.  They can be washed off easily.  The reason for one less star is that he wears a 9 1/2 shoe and these don't come in half sizes so I ordered a size 10 and they are a little large.  But they still work well and he hasn't had a problem with them falling off.  It would be great if Crocs would make half sizes for all.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I had tried 2 other plastic type clogs and they didn't work well for me at all.  These Crocs do.  They don't push down on the tops of my feet.  They are comfortably roomy but stay on my feet fine.  And they provide some cushioning and support for soles of feet, which I need.  I am very happy with them and will order more when these start to wear out.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My old crocs have lasted about 7 years and were starting to look a little ratty, so I decided to get a new pair, exactly the same but a different color.  I just wish there had been more color options available in my size, but that's ok.  For an old hippie who would prefer to go barefoot, these crocs are perfect, like no shoes on at all.  My old ones are still in good shape, so now they are just for around the house, my new ones are my ""dress crocs"" for going to town!",5.0 out of 5 stars
bought these for my 17 year old daughter who really likes crocs.. she loves them.. so that's what matters!  I think the fit is about right. but it was a little bit different than a different pair of crocs she has.. her black ones that I bought at the store are a womens 8 so I ordered that in the white and they were way to huge.. and bigger than her black ones. so we sent them back and got her the womens size 7 and they fit her perfectly..,5.0 out of 5 stars
This is my second pair. My first pair is maybe 8 or 9 years old. I'm not replacing pair #1 I just got tired of having to come in after working in the yard all day and having to wash the dirt off of them before I went somewhere. Now I just change into my new pair. At the rate pair #1 is going I should not have to buy a new pair for maybe 10 more years. F I live that long!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My wife loved the shoes but they were smaller than she thought they would be. She has other shoes the same size that fit her well. Hated to return them. I gave them 5 stars because they were as advertized. Under normal circumstance, she may have been able to ""break them in"" by wearing for a while. She has sever neuropathy from chemo and the shoes cannot be tight because of the pain. Amazon was great to work with us with the return.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I've had these crocs for 2 years now and I still wear them around when running errands etc.  it may not be the most glamorous thing but it sure is comfortable.  These crocs are so durable.  If I had a pair of regular flip flops, I would be on at least my 5th or 6th pair. This crocs have paid for themselves many times over.  I've worn them walking over rocks, stones, in showers, in the house, to the store, camping EVERYTHING.  I loved these things so much I bought a pair for my husband in the REALTREE camouflage and he now likes his. (Plus his old flip flops where there is material really starts to stink when he's walking around so crocs don't smell) Hint hint ladies, buy these for your husbands as well! :)",5.0 out of 5 stars

"You don't wear Crocs for a fashion statement.  Well, maybe in some places, but not most places.  They're the flip-flops of the regular shoe community.  So easy to slip on.  So easy to wash off.  When my kids were little, they were ""big kid"" shoes they could put on themselves.  Now all of my big kids have a pair right outside the backdoor.  Slip them on to do everything year round (we live in Arizona.)  So far nobody has ever accidentally stepped in dog poo, but it could happen and if it did - easily washable.  They wore these shoes at at sleepaway camp for everything from showers to fishing to hiking.  They're durable.  Over the last 6+ years we've owned MANY pairs of Crocs brand originals and think they're all fantastic.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Shoes fit well, and I believe are helping my heel spurs. The only problem I have is that they have a series of small protrusions over the entire sole of the shoe.  For me it causes considerable discomfort.  Maybe I just have sensitive feet, but I almost can't wear them.  Socks help and time wearing them does too.  Because of the low price I wouldn't send them back.  Again, it might just be my sensitive feet. I guess I'm just disappointed and expected they'd be like wearing pillows on my feet. After thinking about it and looking at other reviews, I've decided to take away a star.  Not that it matters much.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I love Crocs and had a pair I had worn out so I bought this pair.  When they arrived I couldn't get my foot in them.  After double checking, the old ones were made in Mexico and these are made in Viet Nam.  The return and reorder was seamless, but if I were to order again I would go up 2 sizes instead one 1.  These pair I ended up with seemed a little more narrow but I'm hoping to stretch them out!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love them.  Because of a botched surgery, my foot is deformed and I cannot wear normal shoes. I lived in Crocs for a long time.  I've been unable to walk without assistance for a long time, and it occurred to me that I needed to replace them, but the pair I had was purple, and it matched a lot of things in my world, clothes, my car! So I just knew that I had to replace them. I couldn't even read the size on the bottom they were so worn.  I couldn't find them in the size I needed due to swelling in my feet so I had to order a larger size.  Luckily they were available in my second favorite color.  I'm walking so much better!

"Very comfortable clog.  However, the turquoise croc (Item # 10001-440) shown in the amazon.com online picture here more accurately depicts what the Electric  Blue Classic Croc clog (Item #10001-404) looks like in person.  I know because I now own both colors.  I had purchased these turquoise crocs for my husband and I.  We ended up keeping the turquoise crocs from amazon.com which are a darker blue green color than shown in the picture.  I fortunately found the two pairs of ""Electric Blue"" crocs that I was originally trying to find in the size needed (USA Size: M8/W10) on another website.  I had to pay a lot more than I would have liked (bought them internationally). The international shipping cost was $45 alone and was more than the cost of 2 pairs of crocs!  Happy to have found the electric blue classic Croc in size M8/W10 because this color has now been discontinued.  Attached is a photo of the 2 colors:",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Super comfortable and lightweight. I normally wear between an 8-9, and purchased the 8 after reading the details saying they are made to be very roomy. I planned to wear them without the strap, so they were perfect. I think I would've needed a 9 if I wanted to wear them comfortably with the strap or thick socks. Sadly, my cats got ahold of them a couple hours after they got delivered 😭 so I won't get a chance to see how they feel worn in.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these shoes for my daughter to wear to the beach and pool!  She loves her Crocs!  The color, size, everything.  They're super comfortable. They're the perfect shoes to wear to an amusement park or water park.  Truthfully, they're not very stylish, but they are very comfortable.  I'm at the point in my life where I choose practicality over style sometimes!  As ugly as these shoes are, I think I'm going to myself a pair for the beach too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had crocs a long time ago and they must have been too big because I didn't enjoy them as much. Maybe the sizing has changed because I absolutely love them. Definitely size your feet as i did and they fit perfectly. I wanted something I could quickly slip on around the campsite getting in and out of my tent. It's cold out so I am actually using them around the house and they are so comfy!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Excellent price (I scored a great holiday deal).  Exactly what my daughter wanted.  Minimal packaging in shipping, i.e. no shoe box and then the shipping container.  These were just in plastic bags and then the outer shipping box.  No big deal to me but if they were a gift, you'll need to plan for that.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had a couple pair of Crocs.  Previous pair was a little big and sloppy.  I ordered the next size smaller and these are a bit too tight.  I could slip on the larger ones without touching them and they'd stay on most of the time with the strap slipping into place.  The smaller ones require a quick finger to pull the strap and then they're a little too tight at the toes.  I wish they made half sizes, but I just fall between that jump in size.  Otherwise, they're good as a slipper and a deck shoe.  They require no care and last a long time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Great comfort in these Crocs!  I don't wear them a lot because I have custom orthotics but when I do (evening for about 15 minutes) I'm in heaven.  I ordered a size 8 and have a wide foot. These shoes let my foot spread out comfortably even more than my shoes with orthotics.  Since I have foot issues, I checked these out on lots of shoe review pages and Web MD as well.  They are highly rated for comfort and fit although I think I would need more support for a 2 mile walk.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are so comfortable.  I said that they do not have good arch support, but I have an extremely high arch and I don't feel it if it's there.  The shoes are contured and someone with a lesser arch may feel the support.  I can wear them all day w/ or w/out socks.  They are also extremely light-weight and that is a bonus!  I have now purchased a pair for my husband which he loves and wears all day too.  I have also purchased two more as gifts... want to share the comfort!  I definitely recommend and they do not run in 1/2 sized... I am at least an 8.5 and usually a 9 and the 8 fits me perfectly.  Hope this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"No matter the stigma about Crocs, they don’t make a more comfortable shoe. As a big man with size 13-14 shoes depending on the brand, these have been great for work.

Yes, I’ve gotten a couple jokes about my styling, but I always counter with how comfortable and functional they are.

"Sadley Crocs only makes this Classic style in the really cool colors.  For me, the classic is not a proper duty shoe.  Its great for me to do food shopping in. Quick errands.

I will definitely buy these again in the future. Like seriously, BUY WHITE CROCS. I promise you, you will love them.

"I was used to purchasing Crocs in the ""from-to"" size range ( 9-10, etc.) so the size setup on these was a bit strange for me. The shoes are fine and I should be able to wear them for quite some time with no problem, but they are a wee bit narrower than my other crocs and since my feet tend to swell a bit in hot weather the narrower width might be a problem. Don't know yet. Otherwise the shoes are great--lovely color (Khaki) is a perfect neutral.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I honestly love crocs but the ones I was sent are defective. The strap is attached too far back on the shoe so it does not stay up. At first I though it was warped from shipping but after many attempts at warming and trying to reshape, the strap is too short. Not the worst problem to have, but the strap sticks up vertically at the top of the foot and  with frequent wear causes irritation on the foot. It has made he shoes unwearable for me",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these because I am a recent Crocs wearer and my favorite color is red. I do not like the nubs inside the footbed because they are too sharp and hurt your feet. I guess I'll have to wear socks with them all the time but that's not what I want to do in the summer.,4.0 out of 5 stars
I believed that when I purchased these croc's that I would be ordering size 7 women's according to their size chart. And the color black. When the croc's arrived they were a size 13 men's but they were black. I called Amazon to find out what happened to my order. I really feel I got the run around with them. They hem-haw about the size and then I was told that they did not come in black. He did tried and give me another type of croc that was suppose to be in women's black size 7. That also was a joke because there was no such number. This is the first time I have had this type of problem with Amazon and I hope that I never do again. I have shopped at Amazon many times before and have never been treated like this before. I suggest if you want croc's some place else.,1.0 out of 5 stars

They fit just right, but being new, the little bumps inside were a bit irritating. To solve this problem, i took a drill and used a wire brush attachment to grind them down a little.

They're light as air and they kind of form-fit to my arches. It's like getting a mini-massage just by walking around. I wear them whenever I'm lounging around the house or doing chores but I don't wear them outside at all. Something else to note: They don't stink. At least not for a long time. I think that's pretty remarkable. When they do start to smell, I couldn't really figure out an effective way to clean them so I just threw them away and bought new ones (they also lose their form a little after a year or so).

Very comfortable! I have concrete tile floors so it helps my back. Bought a less expensive pair to see if I like them and if the size was right. Since they are Unisex shoes check the size chart. For example a Men's size 10 is a Woman's size 12. I wear a size 10 in a sneaker so a size 10 in a Croc was plenty big enough as they fit slightly larger. I wear them as a clog with the strap folded to the front. Great for a slip-on to run to the mailbox. I will get another pair.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I wish they'd been available in my size in another color.  My only option was Khaki, which looks like rice-fed doggy poop.  But I don't wear 'em to look at them.  I wear them because they feel great.  And for the price (under $20, delivered by amazon Prime, go amazon!) I can't complain.  They're great clomp around clogs, keep your feet warm wet or dry, kick out irritants through the many open holes, and are very comfortable on my feet.  I have yet to use the heel strap or take them for a significant walk, but that's not why I bought them.  I wanted super easy on and off, comfortable enough to run errands in, and secure enough on my feet that I didn't have to think about where I put my feet when walking in them.  They fit the bill quite nicely, thank you very much.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I generally go through a pair a month.  It's important to replace them once the sole is smoothed out to avoid slipping dangers.

Great for house shoes or even garden shoes (if all your doing is weeding and not shoveling or digging, lol). I love my crocs and will always have a few pairs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Found the shoes to be rather large, even though they are my size.  Found the sole to be thin--when out walking I can feel stones, etc, through the soles of the shoes.

I never thought I'd buy Crocs. They're ugly. But they were recommended by a friend and I love them. I have Plantar Fasciitis and I needed a pair of shoes I could wear everyday without pain. I would recommend Crocs for anyone with Plantar Fasciitis who wants relief from the condition who can't get into the doctor for some reason or another. They provide relief and my feet are not sore by the end of the day.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These Crocs are extremely large and don't appear to be sized properly. They are sized and mens' 9 and women' 11.

Would not recommend purchasing these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I have worn Crocs for years.  Most comfortable thing I have ever had on my feet!  This is just another fine pair of crocs.  Can be worn outside or as an inside slipper.  I wear mine outside mostly walking.  I usually walk over 5 miles a day.  Have bought expensive walking shoes over the years.  Anything I buy usually needs replacement after 2 to 3 months.  I am very hard on shoes.  These Crocs last just as long, yet only 1/3 to 1/4 the cost.  I can stand for hours in these too, without legs, hips, or feet aching.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I know some people think they have arch support, but I don't feel any.  Then again, I need a really high arch in my shoes.  So take that for what it's worth.

And when I bruised the bottom of my feet I needed to wear softer shoes for several weeks and crocs fit the bill.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was always critical of crocs because, in my opinon, they are some pretty ugly footwear, but I thought I would give them a try. Being in Afghanistan and having to use public showers, you really dont want footwear that is going to fall apart on you. These things not only do the job when it comes to showering, but they are just extremely comfortable. Waking on gravel back and forth from the tent to the showers, you cant even feels the rocks under your feet. As assumed, they breathe really well and just good shoes to wear around and kick back in. The only thing is that they ran rather big and I had to send the first order back. I wear an 11.5 and a 12 was absolutely gigantic. I ordered a pair in 11 from another site later on and they were perfect. yes, they might not be the most visually appealing shoe on the planet, but they are amazingly comfortable and durable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Honestly, I was confused about the sizing. I have bought many of these shoes over the years for my son but always found that the ones marked from Mexico to be far too small.

"I have a pair of Crocs I bought at Dicks and wore them to and around Maui, Hawaii.  The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache.  Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem.  I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles.  She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did,  The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store.  She only had one problem:  her name wasn't Amazon.  I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't.  I hoped the nibs would wear down.  They haven't.  In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs.  Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt.  I  guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't.  I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon.  If I was told I had to make a choice between the two, well I just I hope Amazon will be real understanding when I park my motorhome in their parking lot.  Love the place.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I wish they were a half size longer. I wear 9.5 and this is 9. Half sizes are not available. Otherwise it is a comfortable shoe and seems good quality.

"Since I am firmly a half size, I had to order a size down (which was recommended). It fits just fine, but my toes are a little close to the front. But I got these for gardening and walking out on our deck, so I don't mind since I won't be doing any serious walking or wear with these shoes. I usually wear them without the back strap, which makes my feet fit better I think. The strap I think forces my foot forward a bit. I haven't tried a size up so I can't vouch for how that will fit.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Love these.  Awesome  for arthritis and bunions. I wear Brooks running shoes most of the time but wanted these foe easy things and home wear. I wear a 7 and buy 7 1/2 in Brooks and bought  an 8 in these. Tried a 7 on inthe store and much too small with Socks.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"This is my first pair of Crocs, and I was ambivalent because they are about as unflattering as a shoe can be (and I've seen some ugly shoes). I bought them as a lightweight camp/river crossing shoe for backpacking on friends' rave reviews. I first ordered a 6M8W, and it was long enough without the heel strap on, but the heel strap was so short it pushed my foot forward so my toes were crammed against the front of the shoe.  So I returned it and ordered the 7M9W.  Same problem! See pic. These shoes are boats - long enough and certainly as wide as an ocean liner.  I can't wear them without the strap, or they'd fall off my very narrow feet, but this short strap issue takes nearly 3/4"" off the length and crams my toes into the front of the shoe.  Really disappointing, and uncomfortable.  I know they want the strap to fit against the front when not in use, but it wouldn't take an engineering genius to make the shoe body and strap proportional.  At least the color is cute...",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these 8 years ago because my crew coach recommended them. I was embarrassed by the style, but have grown to love these durable shoes. They're still going strong, haven't shrunk in a hot car, and I wear them every day (one has developed a slight dent in the sole). I've worn them to the beach, (accidentally) to the store, and would probably wear them everywhere if it were more socially acceptable. You have enough room to wear super thick socks in the winter, yet it's not like your foot is flopping around. The arch support is pretty dang good, too. Note: I've tried Crocs in their store, and they were nowhere near as comfy as my own, so not sure if this review is that helpful anymore.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"It seems that the size and toe space is different depending on where the Crocs were produced. The ones from Mexico seem to run smaller with a narrower toe space than the ones from China. This makes it difficult to order because it is not clear as to where the product being sent to me is from, Why should there be a difference in size for the ""same"" shoe? Are the templates used different in different countries. It may need to be stated in the order guide where the product being sent is from, or it would be best if the buyer of the product can choose the manufacturer of the Croc. All of this is moot if there is still a difference in fit between the same products from the same country much less from Mexico vs China. That's why it is so confusing when I read the critiques of the product where some one would say the size is 1/2 to 1 size larger than stated and someone else says it is 1 to 1/2 size too small. The comparison must also state whether they were discussing a Croc produced in China vs Mexico or where ever.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"Purchased the silver Croc and fell in love with them (did not see that coming!).  Sprained my ankle pretty badly a few days later and fortunately had these which were the only shoe I could wear with all the tape and the ankle brace. (Felt fairly stable, too!) Decided to buy some more, so got the khaki. Weirdly tho, the khaki are the same size (per the chart, 10""=9 women)...BUT, the size label on the new package had ""roomy"" on the size label and the Croc is way larger than the same-sized silver purchased before and had fit just dandy. As I pointed out to Amazon, the ""roomy"" designation's explanation was nowhere to be found in the description on the web page. Of course (and I may yet do exactly this), I can keep ordering them and hoping I will get a non-""roomy"" shoe.  But, it does seem a whole lot messier (more work and time) than the seller being clear about the sizes or at least noting that some of the sizes come ""roomy"".  Why was there no description on ANY of the Croc shoes I looked at (studied the size chart on every Croc I looked at, so that wasn't the problem) delineating the ""roomy"" sizing.  It just seems to be common sense.  I know nothing else sized this way and am glad for that.  Imagine a dress or pants that come in a size 9 and a size 9 roomy, but you can't know by the description...  I mean, even then there's designations like ""relaxed fit"" so you are aware of the difference.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I love the little massaging insoles in the shoes as well as the stacked heel which helped to alleviate the pain/pressure I feel when walking barefooted or in regular slippers.

Crocs are my favorite go to slides. Super easy to put on and pretty comfortable to walk around or wear when you go to the store to do some shopping.

Originally ordered the size 10 but it was way too big. Then returned the size 10 for the size 9 and that's a little too tight. It actually is very difficult to wear them with socks.

"I'm very pleased with these Crocs. Never had Crocs before, and I was hesitant about looking goofy, but these are the best knock-arounds I've had in years. I struggle finding slides that will stay on my feet, but these are great—they have the strap thingy in the back that also rotates to the front if you don't need it. Even without the strap, these stay on my feet better than any other slides I've owned. And the support is terrific—the first time I wore them I took a 2.5 mile walk and they were extremely comfortable. They run a little large. I usually wear a men's 10.5, but they don't have half sizes, so I got 10s. They fit great, and if anything might be a bit large. Inexpensive, durable, easy to clean, great for doing yard work, shopping, or whatever.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Crocs are great for those of us with foot issues.  They aren’t the prettiest but when your feet hurt you don’t care about fashion. I have owned many pairs of crocs. This style isn’t my favorite (the Mary Jane style is my favorite) but they serve the purpose. I am on my feet all day. In this style I should have ordered an 8 to have room for thick socks. I am keeping them and will wear thin socks. In the Mary Jane style a 7 is fine. I normally wear a 7-71/2. I recommend them if you are looking for comfort.,4.0 out of 5 stars

For years I made fun of people that wore Crocs... I tried them on and now I won't take them off. They are fantastic. I do everything in these. My wife won't take me anywhere because they are hideous but at the end of the day my feet are comfortable so I don't care.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"If I hadn't owned a pair of original Crocs, I would have given these 5 stars. And these are fine. However, the originals were softer and had a longer strap. I like to wear the strap pushed forward and now the strap is too short to stay forward. If you had the originals, know that the sizing is different. My old ones were women's size 6. These are a size 8, which is my actual size. All that said, these are good for my plantar fasciitis.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Those were (and still are, after many years) soft and comfortable. Because of the reviews, I ordered up a size, and they're HUGE. Because I'd thrown away the wrapping, I won't return them, and I might order a smaller size, just to see. But they're hard and shiny - not at all what I want...at least the back straps seem to be the same length, unlike others that were reviewed. I ordered online because the stores are full of other styles that also just don't fit the same. Very frustrating...",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I've always been a Crocs fan and was ready for a new pair.  I bought two pairs around black Friday when they were on sale and they appear to be irregulars. The pair I got, the heel on the shoe is misshapen/deformed and the support band is quite a bit shorter/tighter on that same shoe, making it a bit uncomfortable. The other pair I purchased was not bagged or on a hanger and had scuffs all over, possibly a return. For the price, I'm not too upset but still - I've never gotten this low of quality from Crocs before, and would be much happier with a pair that fit correctly.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I love my crocs! I wear them everywhere on dry days and even in the shower. I bought one pair in yellow and they were so comfortable I bought another in brown to wear out. The brown ones were different sizing than the yellow ones since the yellow beach ones were size 8-9 and the brown ones size Women's 8M. Both fit fine but the brown ones fit best with thin socks if I wear socks.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Good product. I deploy to bases with ""public use"" showers that everyone uses and this keeps your feet off the ground and clear of the mildew and other unmentionables on the shower floor. They turn white after a while a crack with constant hydration and dehydration of actually taking them into the shower but after 4-6 months of use, I would probably throw them away in that environment anyway no matter how they looked. Very comfortable to wear and just the thing for deployments. Sandals flop around too much.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I still love them though and will buy again.,4.0 out of 5 stars

The size was a little larger than expected, but not unreasonable.  I'm actually glad they are a little larger in hopes that the added size will help improve airflow.

I understand where people are coming from now when they say how comfortable they are.

"I was disappointed in the fit. actually too wide and a little short. I ordered my usual shoe size. Out of three different Croc shoes that I have purchased recently, this was the worst fit. It would help a lot if when ordering, there was more to go on to select a proper fit. Then there is the chance that you did not get the same manufactured shoe as was described. From reading other comments, I feel that my experience in buying  Croc shoe is very similar. Thus my three stars. I love a Croc, when it fits as described.

"I've recently had problems with plantarfaceitis and crocs seem to be an inexpensive solution to the problem. They have a major problem with inconsistency in sizing, however, and their ""fit guide"" is not particularly helpful. There is not croc store near me so online is the only way to go but it is so frustrating to order two pair of identical shoes and not have them be the same size.  I hate returning things, so much hassle and nothing to show for my efforts, so I am keeping them for winter wear with heavy socks. Wish I could count on consistent sizing and a helpful fit guide.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I usually wear a size 10.  Ordered 10's but they were far too big.  Exchanged for 9's.  They're a tad bit small but not uncomfortably so.  I wear them without the strap around the heal.  The couple times I tried they were too small because the strap pushes the foot a little forward.  They are a very comfortable shoe that I will never be caught wearing in public!,5.0 out of 5 stars

I do have a brace to wear on that leg with sneakers, but it becomes uncomfortable after a few hours and the clogs are light weight enough for me to use as an alternative both for several hours but also as a quick way to slip on to go outside to get the mail etc as I am mostly barefooted while at home.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Over the past 5 years, I have worn 3 other size 9 crocs of the identical style, and they all fit fine.  With the new pair, my foot was slipping all around and the crocs felt like they wanted to just fall off my feet.  When I held them up to an older pair, I could see that they were about the same length (maybe slightly longer), but they were clearly wider in the heel.  As a matter of fact the heel exterior of the old croc nested beautifully in the heel cup of the new one, but not vice versa.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"It is hard to rate these according to size, because the pair I received were defective. One shoe felt somewhat small, while the other was impossible to wear, because the strap was too short to stay behind my heel. Like other reviewers, I noticed these were made in Mexico rather than in China. I'm a loyal Amazon shopper and am hoping Amazon will take care of this, because either Crocs has a problem with their merchandise quality online - or these were knockoffs! These shoes didn’t feel right in general, so like other reviewers, I may decide to shop in a Crocs store instead of online.",1.0 out of 5 stars

My Orthopedic doctor wears them, too, and commented on how good they are for anybody who is on their feet most of the working day. I even wear them in the swimming pool. What a great invention. The only gripe I have is you never know what size you are really getting since the company lists the sizes in a number of different ways. My last pair were listed as size 12-13 M. This pair is the same model but did not list that size so I took a chance and got size12 M and they are a bit snug. They need a uniform sizing boss in charge.",5.0 out of 5 stars

My husband bought these for me after I have been stealing his to wear in our basement.  These are so comfortable to wear for hours every day and are even better on my feet that they are actually the right size!  Part of our basement is unfinished and where our washer/dryer is and also our woodstove so we head to the basement quite frequently every day.  It is great to have a pair of shoes that you can slip on pretty quickly and go.  My feet are ALWAYS sore at the end of the night as well and these seem to have good enough support that my feet aren't as bad by the time I go to bed. Very happy with this purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Clogs beat slippers hands down! I wear them with socks most of the time I'm lounging around the house in winter and know I can wear them outside for brief errands and not have to change footwear. With the socks they're warm in winter; without socks in summer, just right. I even wear them boating and swimming! They float in the water if they come off. Great for when the water's bottom is slimy, pebbly or mucky. Virtually no maintenance and wear like steel.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought these for my brother who is going to HAWAII and has always enjoyed his crocs--black and dark brown. Thought the Khaki would be nice for the warm weather.

I have bought a lot of Crocs before from many different stores and these are the first defective ones I've received. The defective part was actually the sole of the shoe. Normally there are these little raised bumps all throughout the sole which allow for air flow under your feet and helps prevent sweating. But these Crocs I received had very very short ones almost like as if the shoe was heavily used or defective. Felt completely different than any other croc I've ever bought and like I had sweaty feet the whole time.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought these to walk the dogs throughout the day (usually for 20 minutes). Also use them when watering plants/shrubs outside, getting mail, or throwing out trash.  More comfortable than flip-flops as they provide no arch support and you can't really walk fast in them.  Have not worn them longer than one hour.  They fit as expected b/c the description does say they run a little large.  I normally wear a 6.5 so I purchased the Women's 6 US.  You have to get used to the cushioning/padding inside.  They're textured with little plastic nubs that massage your soles as you walk. B/c I don't wear socks, when I take them off and walk on the carpet, there's a strange sensation on the soles of my feet.

"As a person who loves crocs but only owns 2 pairs, these are so much fun! I love the bright color and how comfortable these are. I’ve been considering bringing them on vacation but I think I need a different color. My biggest complaint is I wear a size 10 in women’s and they’re always really pricy. Big footed women shouldn’t have to pay $50 for neon shoes, or any shoes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They're comfortable, easy to slog on and off, and because of all the holes, my feet remain cool. The 9M is on the roomy side, but my feet are more wide than narrow. Still, they stay on my feet without use of the back strap. Good purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The Brand X last 6 months for one pair and 9 months for another.  These are well worth the price.  Now, the comfort.  My first pair took me a bit to get used to the 'nubs' on the bottom...I had to wear socks for the first couple of months but with socks or without socks, they were the most comfortable - I took a trip with a Youth Group Geo-caching in San Francisco and if you've ever been geo-caching, you know that you walk and walk and walk - I must have logged over 6 miles in the 3 hours, up hills and down and my feet felt wonderful.

"As other purchasers have noted, the sizing of Croc brand clogs is off. I would guess that these and the pair of Croc Sport clogs are a full size larger than the number sizing would indicated. Because these are clingy to the foot, they don't shift around despite the sizing so we chose not to exchange for a smaller size. Previous non-Croc branded clogs we've owned shrank over time, especially when exposed to a lot of sun so it is possible that Croc brands do the same and account for the generous sizing. Overall, the build quality is quite good and these Crocs are comfortable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Not good on hot days. Wear with socks if you plan to wear them all day. The grip on the sole is much better than the off brand ones. Still won't wear them on wet ground after slipping badly with my old ones. I do use them as pool shoes though. Buy them a little bigger than you would think because if they are too tight and you wear them without socks you can get blisters easily. My friends kid wears these all the time and he gets blisters because he runs in them. The off brand ones I originally bought i told myself they were for gardening. After slipping a few too many times and being freaked out by bugs crawling in the little holes and I don't use them for that anymore.

"I have worn heels most of my adult life and my feet are finally retaliating. I have been wearing flip flops around the house but the soles were too thin and I was sick of something between my toes, so I took the leap and purchased some crocs. I am so happy with them- perfectly comfortable, easy to slip on and off, my feet don’t ache, fantastic for wearing around the house/yard.

"I have ordered Crocs before (about five years ago) to wear outside while working in the yard. They are great for that purpose - when you get ready to go back in the house you can simply hose them off. My old Crocs had worn down to the point where they were so smooth they could be slippery on a concrete floor, so I decided to order these . Since I loved the old ones, I tried to get the exact same shoes. My old ones were made in Mexico so I ordered the ones that were also made in Mexico in the same size.  The new ones were a lot stiffer and somewhat smaller. I can still wear them but they aren't as comfortable or as well made as the old ones.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"These Classic Clogs are a staple for summertime, and I was able to purchase these for 1/2 price from Amazon! As usual, they fit true to size yet are roomy enough for my feet to breathe. The cutouts provide plenty of avenues for airflow. They are comfortable enough for me to walk in them all day long. They're not as cute or stylish as some of the other Crocs styles, but I can slip them on easily for quick errands or outside work so they're very practical. I just replaced my first pair, which were almost 10 years old, so they are durable as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These fits as expected & seem comfortable. This is my first time buying Crocs because I was looking for a new type of shoe to wear around the house rather, than flip flops or western boots, so Im trying these. The sole has a bumpy texture, which im not used to, but if I can get used to that I think these will work great. The plastic on the outside seems decently solid while the inside is semi spongy & comfortable. Since im rough on my foot wear this is a bonus. Hopefully these will last a little while!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Absolutely love it! Except one point, it gets slippery inside the Crocs when wet ... so expect to slide out of them easily which is somewhat tricky ... but definitely need to buy more pairs :D ... but they're light and until now durable, a bit soft on the toe part, where the crocs could be harder above all in bigger sizes like mine ...",5.0 out of 5 stars

I normally wear 8-8 1/2 shoe size.  I tried some clogs size 8 on and they fit my feet perfectly.  My feet are a little wide so these may be a little wide for some people.  They provide great support for my feet and I love how light they are.  I am glad there are holes in the uppers of these shoes.  Without them they would be to hot to wear.  I am completely unfashionable since I always wear socks with mine.  I don't care if people cringe when they see me in them.  That is better and less disgusting than letting my feet sweat all over in these things.,5.0 out of 5 stars

With Crocs, my freedom is not inhibited and I don't know what I would do without them. Immediately on taking off my street shoes and stockings, I slip into my Crocs and don't mind them at all.

"I usually buy from a Croc store and am disappointed with the fit of these.  Comparing the soles with the ones I've been wearing, these are definitely smaller.

I would not recommend these for any style purpose, and I don't think I will ever wear these out of the house, but they are soooo much more comfortable than flip flops.

"My crocs arrived promptly, much sooner than I had anticipated. At first I didn't realize the Cayman was a modified version of the original Beach clog. Modified in the sense that it is made to stay on your foot more snugly, probably for aquatic use. If you find them to be a little too tight, its easy to fix. Pop them in the dryer for about 3 minutes. I tossed in a towel to cut down on the noise. Don't go over 3 minutes, though! Have some socks on your feet, pull out the Croc Caymans and put them on your socked feet. Stretch them just a tiny bit with your feet and let them cool. They should fit much better after this!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The size W9/M7 is identical to W8/M6, both made in Mexico, with the strap being shorter than before. Inconsistent sizing makes it virtually impossible to buy online. This model is called Classic and is supposed to substitute for Cayman, but the sizing is all wrong.

What's not too like about crocs? They last forever.  Sizing has changed since I bought my last pair as they used to be mens 10-11 now it is size 10 or 11. I think I read somewhere on crocs website if you wear a half size to order a size down.  The size 10 fit well.  My suggestion would be to try them on at a store and then order them on amazon as the price is better.  This way there should be no sizing issues.

They're also waterproof, so you can use them in the shower, or at the pool or beach, if you wish. I bought my first pair 5 years ago, and it's indestructible; I only bought this second pair because I needed it to use on vacation.

It gave a price range and it was difficult to find why some were so much cheaper.  You would have to put in each pair individually to see the price according to color (of which there were many)  I called customer service who called me back and let me know the mud and one shown were the cheapest by several dollars.

Good quality. Fit somewhat small. My husband wears a size 11 so that is why i ordered this pair. They do fit but with no room to spare. His heel comes right to the end.

Even though the Caymen is supposed to be a closer fit than the Beach, they still feel very loose, as if they're going to fall off, at first. But after getting used to them and forgetting I had them on, I realize that this contributes to the comfort. Unlike my usual sandals, these dry by simply wiping them off which is a huge benefit in wet environments. I still think they're fugly but they're extremely comfortable for wear around the house or camp, and light enough to always take with you on your travels.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"This is my second set of khaki Crocs, I love them. Perfect footwear around house, going to store, camping, beach even water parks.

I have several Crocs now, will almost certainly always own a few from now on.

"Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip flops and to dry my feet out after walking around in boots or being wet all day.  However, the site suggested going up half a size if you are inbetween. I generally wear a 9.5 military boot or a 10 in regular shoes. I went with a 10, and the back strap barely catches on my heel as I take a step.  Fine for walking around on dry ground, indoors, at the pool etc.  However, it's a bit too large to walk around in muck, submerged water (creeks etc) because it just isn't tight enough.

These Crocs are incredibly durable & comfortable.  I go through 1 pair a year.  I have tried different brands and different styles but I keep coming back to these (Unisex classic clog)  I wear a size 15M in a standard shoe.  Ordered a size 15 and they fit well.  Room around my foot so I don't feel squeezed but not so much that my shoes fall off.  The shoes themselves do stretch over time but as they stretch the shoe also begins molding to my foot which makes it even more comfotable.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I wear 8 1/2 wide in standard women's shoes, and 8W, 6M in crocs was always perfect for me before. Now I think I would order a size up next time, even on what Croc bills as a ""roomy"" fit.

"This is my first pair of Crocs and I love them!  I have a wide foot and comfort is key.  Crocs reminded me of the white ""earth shoes"" I wore back in the 70's & 80's while working in the medical field.  I remembered they weren't the most attractive shoes (looked like I had ""duck feet"") but they were comfortable.  I have friends that wear Crocs and decided to give them a try.  I usually wear an 8-1/2 or 9 and was torn between sizes.  Crocs recommends you order down to the next whole size if you are in-between sizes.  I ordered Classic Crocs / size W9 and I thought they were slightly longer than I needed so I ordered an 8 to be sure.  The length of the foot bed for the 8 was fine but I found the toe box to be a little snug on my littlest toe.  I kept the 9's and am glad I did.  I work in an office of a manufacturing plant with a casual dress code. Most of the building has concrete floors and the Crocs are just perfect for me.  I have since bought another pair in a different color and a pair of Crocs sandals.

"Had/have plantar fasciitis and crocs are the only shoe I could tolerate comfortably until the swelling left my foot. On days when it is aggravated again, revert from shoes with a support insert back to my crocs.  I have also given up my faithful slippers and use only crocs as my slippers when in the house. Their arch support ""for me"" is perfect and my foot doc agreed that they are pretty good for that type footwear.

I order crocs for the entire family for summer and our upcoming camping trip. I had an issue with quality control as one of the straps that was meant to hold my foot in was too long. It ended up being even with the back part of the shoe rendering it useless. The other shoe was fine and was about 1/4 to 1/2 inch shorter allowing for my foot to be secure. Of of the other 3 pairs I have this is the only defect but heard quality had diminished since they are made in Mexico now and not China.,2.0 out of 5 stars

I put classic in quotation marks, because Crocs loyalists know that they were once made in the USA, and the shoes that were made in the USA were sized in ranges and were made of superior material that was a tad bit softer.  Please know that I'm traditionally not a hooah-hooah ""Made in the USA"" minion, but there are distinct differences between the USA- and Mexican-made Crocs.  Crocs made in Mexico are made of a similar (but different) material that has a slippery finish, and they are sized in whole-sizes only.

I also use them for boating on a pontoon boat and for general, quick around-town use.  These clogs fit the bill perfectly.  They are durable, don't get dirty easily, are very easy to clean, and provide the foot with protection without stifling the foot.  I'm very satisfied with this product.

Good support, and they stretch with my feet throughout the day, so no pinching.  They do seem to shrink overnight, because they don't seem overly large the next day.  Obviously not very fashionable, but I was not looking for fashion, just shoes I could wear in semi-comfort.  I usually wear a 7.5/8 women's, and ordered these in a women's 8, which are fitting well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love these crocs.  This is the first pair I've owned.  They are very comfortable.  You need to be aware that they run large so you should buy a size smaller than your usual shoe size.  I usually wear a woman's 9.5 or 10.  I bought a woman's size 9 and they fit perfectly.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I guess you really should to go through croc's website to check they're information on sizing of a particular style and then order where ever you want.  These will fit great with socks, but are loose without.  For wet summer weather, I guess I'll just slosh around a bit.

I work in a hospital and these are great and comfortable. The best thing is that my feet breathe and don't get smelly like a canvas or leather lace up or even slip on do. I have a box full of other canvas/leather lace ups that degrade inside over time as well as slip on famous brands that have now become my garden shoes as I can't wear them anymore for daily work as they wore out. Another thing is that you can wash crocs and these don't lose shape or fall apart inside.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Way too narrow. Plus the dimples in the bottom make me feel like I have pebbles in the show. Arch doesn't even come close to allowing comfortable wearing.

So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them.  According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down.  A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot.

I've tried other molded plastic shoes, but the other brands are too narrow and the toe box is shallow. These are nice with socks or bare foot. So many colors to choose from!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Crocs Classics, are my favorite shoes to wear.  They are super comfortable, like walking barefoot on a soft cushion.  In cool weather I wear them with thick wool socks.  Their ease of removal and comfort make them the perfect airport shoe, like wearing slippers.  Crocs are designed to float loosely around your foot, so order a size larger than your normal shoe size.  I keep my newest pair for travel and ""going out"", and use my older pairs for hiking, biking, yard work, and almost every activity. If you like taking your shoes off before you come in your home, you will love Crocs step-in/step-out ease (I rarely use the fold-back heal-strap).  Think they look funny?

So maybe they're not so stylish but I don't care, they are comfortable which counts much more with me.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I have a problem with my arches and need to use orthotics.  I have been wearing my old crocs along with my inserts for at least 5 years or better and have always found them so comfortable.

"I have been wearing Crocs as slippers for at least 15 years- very comfortable all day on hardwood floors. I have purchased about 10 pairs over that time. This is the best-fitting pair yet. I wear a size 8 normally and this pair is true to fit. I have bought Crocs manufactured in China, Canada, Mexico and even the US (I think, a long time ago).

I prefer the slightly darker shade.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I would not wear them without socks, feel like that would end up pretty smelly after a few times wearing them like that. My favorite part of these are the ventilation holes - the AC in the car can actually cool my feet after a long day! I live in Phoenix, so that is actually a really big deal - I used to take my shoes off for the drive home to keep them from getting so hot, and you really aren't supposed to drive barefoot! The squishy foam is quite comfortable as well. Some flooring materials (laminate specifically) will make these squeak when walking, but not much different from my danskos honestly.

It is best to avoid gravel but these shoes really take a beating and keep on going. My son says the last pair lasted him about 3 years. I know for sure they last him 2 years. These are the most comfortable light weight shoes to wear if you get the right size. They come only in full sizes, no half sizes. You must remember to not expose these shoes to high heat. You can wash them in your washing machine but do not dry them in the dryer and do not leave them sitting out in the sun light or near something too hot. These shoes should easily last you from 1 to 2 years or longer. They are sturdy except for being exposed to heat. If you don't like the heal strap flip it forward and use them as a slip on shoe. These are wonderful if you have to work in water, like when you are washing your car, etc. The only other caution is to know that hard things like thorns, nails, sharp things can easily penetrate the souls of these shoes. The souls are quite thick but remember it is a foamy material and easy to poke through or cut. These shoes are amazingly comfortable and wear a long time and well worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They are great and versatile.  I wear them all the time around outside in the barn and while gardening.  They hose right off for cleaning.  I like them mostly because 1)  the can be worn with the heal strap down around your heal or up to just slide your feet in and out  2)  they have these little bumpy things for the bottoms of your feet and they keep your feet feeling good.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fit is fine.  I wear these around the house as I cannot go barefoot because of foot issues.  However, I always fold the heel strap forward and it will not stay.  Very aggravating.  I didn't return because I thought after awhile they would stretch enough to stay.  So, my only option at this point is to try and remove the strap without harming the shoe.  I have owned LOTS of pairs of crocs since I wear them every day.  First time this has ever happened.  Very disappointed and will never order them online again for this reason.",1.0 out of 5 stars

BOTH were way too large lengthwise and were WAY too wide for a woman's foot (I'm talking like 2"" too wide in the heel).

I do not use the ankle strap so that makes them fit loosely. I feel for the price they were a good deal.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I told myself I would never buy this style of Croc, but I figure as a house shoe, I could make an exception.  I have hard wood floors and am super pregnant, so every step was beginning to really hurt.  I've heard good things about these, so I bought the cheapest color in size huge because my feet are in fact, huge.  They fit fine and have definitely eliminated a lot of my foot pain, however, my feet are sitting in a sauna.  I have to wear socks with them and I still have super sweaty (and not to mention, stinky) feet. I'm not one to have ever had a sweaty or stinky foot issue, but in these I'm queen gross foot.  I knew this would be an issue to an extent, but wow, this is ridiculous.  I'll switch between these and my gel flip flops (which don't do much for me) throughout the day, just to give my feet a breather.  Are they comfortable?  Yes.  Would I have bought them if I knew how my feet would handle this material?  Nah.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Very comfy. Doesn't slip, even on wet tile. Walked in the rain and my foot kept slipping on the inside. Made it uncomfortable to walk. Also, I have long toes and the third toe hits the front of the shoe. So I can't wear these long distance. Good as an inside/gardening shoe.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These ran large on me.  Also they didn't feel like the comfort squishy crock material of my previous pair... more plasticky if that makes sense.  But the reason they went back is they were too long and too wide.... and I already have pretty wide feet so I can't imagine if someone had slender feet.... it'd be like trying to wear a hallway.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these to replace a pair I bought 18 years ago. As others have noted, the current ""Classic"" model is made with a stiffer material than the original...this is absolutely correct. I prefer the softer original, but I'm pretty sure the copycats don't make the soft ones anymore, either. These are also slightly narrower, and the raised rubber nubs feel pointier (maybe because of the stiffer rubber?). Otherwise, these are almost identical to the 18 year old model. I usually like to buy products from the innovator, even if they're more expensive than the copycats, so I may buy these again in the future. On the other hand, the most desirable features have been pretty much designed out of the product, so, when it comes time to replace these, I may go with an entirely different product.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"never liked to look but bought a pair of cheapo knockoffs and wear them around the house, they walk great but the knockoff plastic in the upper is a little stiff so ordered the real deal  based on reviews.  Cost 5 times more money in the local store, about 35% less on AMZ.  The knockoffs are a US Mens 10 so ordered mens 10.  Well, they were so large they would not stay on.  Plastic is much more supple so I was sold on going with the Crocs.  Went to local store and tried mens 9 which felt fine so sent 10s back and ordered  a 9 but they are very small. Fit more like an 8 shoe.  They are so small my toes dig into the front.  So sending those back.  Great for walking and comfortable but even though they are obviously molded in one piece there must be differences from machine to machine, plant to plant or something.  I read that these will shrink in sunlight perhaps the 9s were sitting around a while an shrank?  Very disappointed and now another return back to Amazon.  Seems I'll have to go local to find a pair to fit.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I was hesitant to purchase this type of shoes because I rather ware leather shoes. However I needed a pair of comfortable shoes that could get wet without getting damage, so I decided to give it a shoot. I opened the bag and the shoes did not have a plastic smell (that was good) I inspected the shoes and I founded them very light. The violet pearly color is very nice (more of what I expected). I wore the shoes without socks. I noticed that the bottom of the shoes had some texture which gave me a very nice massage while walking. A couple of hours later I realized that I should ware them with socks next time because my feet were getting all sweaty. The next day I used them with thin socks and went to a picnic. I was so amazed how comfortable the shoes were. I am the type of person that will not buy a pair of shoes if they are not comfortable. Now I do understand why so many people use this type of shoes. Oh I forgot to mentioned.. I received complements on my shoes (this...I did not expect it at all). Overall, I am very happy with my purple crocs!

"Man, I used to think crocs were one of the most hideous shoes ever (after Uggs, of course) but after owning mine for a few weeks, I have completely changed my mind. They are the only shoes I can be on my feet all day with and not feel any foot discomfort. It would be ideal if they were slip resistant, but I'll be okay. I think the fact that they are so comfy, easy to clean, and breathable has made them beautiful to me. I even wear them to go out, which I used to make fun of people for. Go ahead, make fun of me, but I am comfortable! :-)",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I really wanted to have a pair of Crocs.  It seems like everyone who has a pair loves them.  Unfortunately, they do not fit well for me.  Even with a smaller size than I usually wear, they made my feet look huge.  The just seemed to slip off of my feet.  I wish I could wear them.  They have a reputation for easy fit and style.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I have no idea if it's just me, but I normally wear a size 12 boot, sandal, sneaker, dress shoe, slipper, you name it! But these, for a size 12, were at LEAST two sizes two big, unless you're supposed to wear them with winter socks! Maybe I don't understand the style and they're supposed to be uncomfortably huge. I exchanged for a size 11 due to the fact that amazon's selection process for these is confusing and leaves much to be desired. However, after returning these and the size 11's I had to order size 10's from eBay. The return process was simple and I got 100% back, including shipping!",4.0 out of 5 stars

these shoes ran way to big. I am very disappointed in the sizing. If I would have bought them off the crocs website it would have not been an issue.,1.0 out of 5 stars
i wear size 14 boots with a little wiggle room in the toes but im always a extra wide foot so thats what screwed me. size 14 croc had just enough toe space but very tight around my feet. i think its safe to say i needed size 16 in these.  but ordering a 16 seemed insane at the time. after i returned the size 14 i got for $15 i went to order the size 16 but they jumped from $20 to $35 and still holding at that price. i was sick of flip flops breaking and excited to try cocs but im not happy with the sizing or price hikes. i hope to own the 16 someday but even if they fit better it was a lot of plastic-on-skin contact and feet got very hot and dirty. i see why people wear socks with these. i live in FL so foot wear that is not hot is important. all in all im just not impressed and wished they would of fit the first time. i would of gave them 3 stars probably if they fit. i dont see this product being worth 5 stars or worth over $20 no matter the fit.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these because someone told me they were very comfortable.

"Been wearing these for years. Very comfortable. Only problem I have is the strap breaks off, the little plastic thing that it snaps into seems to fall off after a year or so, and of course you can never find it again, so I end buying another pair. Usually worn enough that I do not mind a new pair.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"When I deployed to Iraq back in 2008, I bought these to use as shower shoes.  They worked very well offering a decent grip on the shower floor.  I used them for an entire year while I was deployed and they held up great.  Not just in the shower trailers, but also when  walking on the desert ground that was super hot.  After using them in Iraq, I decided to just throw them out as I wasn't about to bring them home after using everyday in public showers.  Upon my return I bought another pair that I wear to go outside or down in my basement.  I give 4 stars only because the sizing is a little off.  I am a 9.5 so I ordered size 9 which was too small.  I returned that pair, with ease might I add thanks to Amazon free return, and ordered a size 10.  The size 10 is slightly too big but not to the point where it's annoyingly coming off my foot.  The back strap does the job in keeping them on my feet.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"These are great casual lightweight sandals that are cushy and mold to your feet.  They are also great for wearing in/around water.  I bought a pair for myself and my hubby, who loves his as well.  Our only complaint is that these sandals get dirty easily.  We both got black, so it is always a little dusty on the outside (makes it look like dark grey), and when we wear around the yard or around town, we often get dust, pebbles, and grass in our shoes.  I suppose if you wore them where there was zero debris on the ground, they'd be the perfect shoes!  They are also easy to clean, however - just damp paper towel or cloth wipes it clean.  Fairly good traction below, too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Newbies: Wearing Crocs is not like wearing shoes. They weigh next to nothing and are cushiony without feeling spongy. Your feet don't have to 'grab' them to stay on: you walk effortlessly, even with the backstrap worn forward over your arch, like clogs. They are waterproof, so the shoes are great for gardening, and the ventilation holes will help your feet breathe; you don't have to wear socks, but I do to avoid any hint of sweaty feet. That's not a real problem for me, but feet vary.  After a short period of wearing them, they become even less noticeable as they conform to your feet. Two days later, most of you won't remember any problems, if you had them. Note: They will wear out eventually, especially if you wear them frequently on concrete. Replace them when the soles wear down, before they become dangerously slippery.",5.0 out of 5 stars

My review does not have to do with the comfort of the Crocs but as to the sizing.  The actual Croc itself feels very comfortable and I can see myself wearing these for long periods of time.  I wear a size 8.5 Men's size shoe.  Since there are no half sizes I increased Croc to size 9.  When I tried the Crocs the were too big.  I re-ordered the Crocs in a size 8 and they are a perfect fit.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I have owned a pair of crocs for about 8 years and wanted a new style so I bought these. The old ones was made in China and the rubber is a lot different than the new crocs that are made now in Mexico. If you leave these crocs in the sun they will shrink a size down. My old crocs I store them on my back porch and they get full sun and have never shrunk. I left these new ones from Mexico in the sun for only a few hours and they are at lease 1/2 size smaller now. My big toe hits the end now as before it didn't. My husband bought a new pair last year and told me they are a lot different than our old pairs and he swore they shrunk when he left them outside but I didn't listen and when I got my new pair it did the same thing. The rubber on the Mexico one's is like a shiny rubber as the old one's from China is a dull rubber. The China ones seems a little thicker also. I don't know why the company started using Mexico to make them but I wished they would go back to China because the old ones are a lot better. I went to a store that sells them and checked them all and they are all made in Mexico. I think the old ones are more comfortable also.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I really like my clogs. I just don't like the way they look. And I wouldn't have considered them but I had to travel very light at some point and was jealous of a friend's clogs that served her well. The weight is amazingly low. So I tried them on and they are so comfy. First I didn't buy any because locally they are rather pricey but then I found them on amazon for a very reasonable price. I only wear them at home because I think they are really ugly but at home I wear them all the time. The are great for the garden because you can just hose them off if they get muddy. They are great for inside because they don't slip and the material warms up fast in the winter to keep my feet warm. The are treated with something antibacterial so they don't start to smell in the summer when your feet are sweaty. And they are made in Mexico which I prefer over made in China, for some reason including the short way to transport them. I like the strap in the back too. It is good if you have to walk further with them (which I usually don't but it is good to have options).",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable.  I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor.  The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them, and I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might.  In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these.",3.0 out of 5 stars

And I think it probably took a while for me to learn to walk in them without tripping a little now and then -- there is a little extra length in them, but I think they are supposed to fit that way.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"As a homecare nurse, I am on my feet all day. Before purchasing Crocs, my back and feet hurt by the end of the day. Since wearing Crocs, I have not had this issue. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they are rather ugly looking.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Great for the Texas heat! Love these shoes! So when I first saw them I thought they looked a little silly...gardening shoes that went mainstream.  But after my husband and grandson started wearing them and raving about them, I had to try.  So glad I did!",5.0 out of 5 stars
My daughter was excited to finally own a pair of Crocs.  The excitement was short-lived:  they were broken after wearing them only FOUR times.  She is sad and very disappointed ☹️,1.0 out of 5 stars

Wear these Crocs with a pair of checkered pants and a T-shirt to finish off the look,5.0 out of 5 stars
This is the third pair for my husband. He wears a 7 1/2 mens shoe and we have found the size 7 mens croc is the correct size.  Crocs are very comfortable.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"not sure as the sizing is so messed up. these are way to wide and a bit too long. I am keeping them in hopes they can be used next year, but I will not be ordering a replacement pair from here",3.0 out of 5 stars
Great product but they run small.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Bought these for my father because he wore his old pair to the point where there is little left between his feet and the ground. Soon as he got these he threw his old ones away and put these on and walked around like nothing changed. Cant get any better than that.,5.0 out of 5 stars
My son had a size 4-6 that fit but were worn out so I got the sz 5-7 thinking he would grow into them.  The 5-7 are less wide and shorter than the 4-6.  Probably too late to have them returned now --it took me awhile to figure it out.,2.0 out of 5 stars
My prior pair bought in a store fix perfectl .  This is the exact same style and size but are 1/2 size too large.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Was so surprised that they are so big and wide.  Also, the first thing that happened was one of the straps popped off (one side).  I figured out hold to put it back on - but it disengages easily.  I purchased a pair of ""knock-off"" not really Crocs in Mexico for $10 and they are 100% superior to the real deal.  SO surprised and disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Shoes fit perfectly but there was a weird orange stain on them I saw when I first opened the package. Possibly used shoes and then resold?,3.0 out of 5 stars

these fit as expected with no problems and are great shoes :)  no sizing problems like some of the other crocs on amazon.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I wear a size 9 - 9 1/2 in most shoes.  I bought the 9M hoping they wouldn't be too snug. They are a little large but still comfortable.  I feel pretty confident the size 8 would be just right.  I bought them to wear around the fire station at night and they work great.  Easy to slip on, nice and soft.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've bought crocs before from amazon and they were perfect. But these seem like they don't have any cushion and they rub on the side of my foot causing a blister even thought I've given them over a week of wearing to ""break them in."" The other ones never needed to be broke in.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"As has been stated before, it would be great if these came in half sizes.  They really come in as too small or too large if you are a 1/2 size. Not comfortable.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"These Crocs are fine... BUT... they are HUGE!!  a full size larger than stated, IMO... I send them back and ordered a size smaller... no problem, the onew I ordered as replacement have the real leather and are nicer... for $5 more.  :-)",3.0 out of 5 stars

"One issue I'd to resolve is that many styles of Croc run big. And that's true of this one, the Classic clog, so order down a half-size if your normal size happens to be one that Crocs doesn't make.",3.0 out of 5 stars
