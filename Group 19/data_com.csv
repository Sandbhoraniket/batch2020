"I was scheptical about ordering this due to the bad reviews, but I thought I would give it a try. Although the phone arrived in record time and looks brand new, the battery only holds a charge for about 2 hours, and dies at 40%. Seller was no help. I am returning, but will give them another shot. I'll update when the second one arrives.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I originally gave this phone a good review (see below). Bought it in May, it is now October. The battery started overheating so ordered a new one. The overheating battery fried the screen so had to replace that also. Already the new battery is overheating. The screen is extremely sensitive so it frequently goes on hold or turns on the speaker phone while I am on a call, just from a slight touch to my face. Also, the phone does not hold a charge for very long. It seemed like a good price but it only lasted for 5 months before I had to have it fixed. It now looks like it's pretty much done for and I will need yet another phone. Essentially, I have rented a phone for 5 months for $150 plus the repair bill for the battery and the screen. About $50/month... seems a little high.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bought it to replace a broken phone(android). Couldn’t activate it. Was told by Sprint customer service the reason I cannot activate it was I didn’t start my plan with this model - I started my plan with a higher model. So they cannot activate with anything less that what I started with in my plan. Really?! Too much work to return it. So I let my toddler use it as an iPod (using wifi only). Nowhere did I find any information from people or reviews about the reason I couldn’t activate the phone. So make sure you check with your service provider before getting any replacement phone from anywhere. A lesson learned.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this phone to send it to overseas to a family member. Therefore, I have read every detail the seller wrote about this phone. It was stated as ""fully tested and worked"" ""apple certified"" ... etc , but none of these are true I'm my case. The battery of my phone can't stay on for 5 minutes phone call. Please buy from other sellers.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"What a Horrible Phone. I tweaked all the settings to give a longer battery life (turned off all location services and all notifications) and the phone goes from 100% Full Charge to 31% in just under 4 hours of browsing, messaging and texting ONLY. At 31%, it shuts off and when I try to restart, it shows 0% battery.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"We are particularly pleased with this refurbished phone. After much research and prior excellent experiences with Apple refurbished products, we decided the 5s 16 gb was the way to go. This phone appears to be showroom fresh in every way. We held our breath as the previous refurbished I phone 5 obtained through Amazon was thoroughly unsatisfactory. (This was from an outside vendor) The last phone had large gouged on the top sides and some sort of Smith on the case which we couldn't remove.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this phone for my niece for Christmas. Before I purchased it, I made sure it started that it was compatible with Straight Talk. I bought a sim card and one month of service from Straight Talk for the phone. On Christmas when my niece tried to activate it with Straight Talk, they said that it wasn't compatible. I have reached out to the company with no return call or email. I just wasted my money either on the phone itself or the monthly plan I purchased from Straight Talk. If the situation gets resolved I will change my rating. Right now I'm not a happy buyer.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This started out fine then within 3 months the battery or battery connection is a major problem . Once unplugged and at 100 charge, it last 2 min and phone shuts off. Tried everything and it all just shuts down till you plug it in, it comes back then shuts down again! Guess it was turned in for a reason! You get what you pay for I guess!",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Agree with review by Chris Robotham. The item description specifically says this is a GSM phone compatible with AT&T networks. The phone I received is marked as a Verizon phone for CDMA networks. This is the exact opposite of what the product description says. The phone appears to work (so far) but is not the item described. I am keeping the phone, but would not buy it again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I am very satisfied with my iPhone.  There is a lot to learn yet, but I am amazed so far at what i can do with this cell phone.  i have all my phone contacts listed and I like the crisp reception I get on long distance with AT&T.  I have added some games that I enjoy playing on the computer.  The reception is really good, with  bright, clear colors..  Learning new things every day.  5-star rating.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Purchase this phone for my husband to use while deployed. This device is very crappy. Also I am using Apple chargers the phone still will not hold a charge. It will jump from 100 to 45 Percent in less than 10 minutes. Then it will turnoff which makes me think that there is a problem with the battery,1.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this phone because I was going on an overseas trip. Actually bought 2 phones but only one from this vendor. The phone was defective as it would not hold a charge. I was very disappointed as I could not communicate with the US with the phone dying with 30 minutes of being disconnected from charge.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"This phone lasted approximately 2 months, the speaker volume on my phone calls didn't work. THe phone was very slow. I saw that the glass was peaking out of the frame. At some point, it barely moved from screen to screen, Highly disappointed but I learned my lesson.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Works almost like new, which is to be expected from a ""Certified Refurbished"" product. Only complaint is the power button; only the left half of the top button works, and pressing the right side has no effect. This has proven to be a minor annoyance, but when you consider the comparatively low price of this product, that's a drawback I'm more than willing to accept.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Phone did not work: home button did not work at all and phone turned off randomly even when fully charged. Since it was ""Certified Refurbished,"" I find that unacceptable. Buy at your own risk. Also beware, the positive reviews seem fake. I would normally rebuy a defective product but given my experience I'm going to go another route when buying a new phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I was a terrible purchase. I saved up my money to buy this and wasted every penny. I needed a new phone because my phone battery was damage and drained within seconds. Then when I buy this one, and not only did it have a cracked screen, but It also has battery issues. I cannot take it off the charger without it dying within seconds. I emailed you guys to get a refund or a replacement but was ignored.

"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she was so excited to get it.  Since the beginning the signal was incredibly weak ( I have other Iphones that the signals are fine where I live) like something was wrong with the attenna.  Now 3 months later, despite her taking great care of it and it still looking like new the phone is inoperable and will not turn on but only flashes when charging.  I understand that it was a used phone but for the cost and for it only to last 3 months is a bit ridiculous.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I wanted to go back to a smaller phone after using the phablets for the past 5 years starting with the Note 2.  I was in Japan for a summer and noticed that nobody was using an oversized phone.  Thought that was interesting, so I bought this and it's been great.  It just fits in hand better, I can reach all parts of the screen with my thumb, and the battery just lasts longer than the new phones.

Would you not think a phone would work after 1 month of use. The ringer toggle quit working after having it for 31 days. Would like a replacement but they have a return policy of 30 days. I think they know more about the garbage they are selling then they let on.,1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought this for my girlfriend and everything seems to work properly.  Activated it this morning and we're just waiting for the carrier to update it so data works.  Only issue is we have to push the right side of the power button to turn it on and off.  Holding the middle of it only locks the phone.  Probably because the power button was replaced when refurbished.  Other than that it's fine.  I will be ordering myself one next week from the same seller.,4.0 out of 5 stars

"So I gave it a star because I received something in the mail.  We have the phone now activated and have tried to work with it for almost 2 months.  Out of the box (obvious 3rd party refurb) the packaging was cracked, an edge was chipped, and it had all the pertainate information on a big sticker, that took goo gone to remove, on the back of the phone.  The data has never worked on this phone.  We have been arguing with Net10 this whole time blaming them for the shorty service but now believe it has to do with the hardware. For the last 3 or so weeks a new development is random, back to back repeated, unprompted restarts.  We don't tell it to do it.... it just does.  Today I pulled it out of the case we have it in only to fine that as I turn the phone something dense shifts inside.  I have to assume that this is the battery loose inside the case as there is nothing else with this kind of density in the hardware.  I have to imagine that if the battery is loose and has been the delicate internals are likely a mess.  I will update posting as soon as I hear from those seller on this l, so far, abysmal example of Apple hardware.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I was able to hook it up through Cricket thank goodness because I was frustrated that it wouldn't work with straight talk I'm just glad that I got it hook up for her at all. That said I'd you plan on hooking up with ST I would recommend a AT&T version. Not this one. Some other reviews say yes on ST but it is hit and miss I was just glad to have found Cricket that would hook it up with unlimited for 40 bucks. Anyways good luck.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I would charge the phone to its full capacity which was 81% according to the phone, it would only last me about 5 hours if that without me even using it. as the weeks went on it only got worse and worse. The IPhone would die on 50% and not turn back on until i connected it to a charger, after i plugged it in it would go back to 50 % charged. to this day it continues to not hold a charge",1.0 out of 5 stars
"It was not an AT&T phone it was a Verizon phone. Anyways it worked, but the refurb was mediocre at best. There were a lot of scratches on the phone. It was not aesthetically pleasing as I'd hoped.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"This is a replacement and upgrade to a previous version. The price was affordable and given my past experience as a iPhone holder, as well as iPhone's sterling track record, I know I'd get good mileage from this item. I'm very happy with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I was concerned, earlier, after I had purchased a reconditioned iPhone from another seller. This was some 2 years ago. I am totally satisfied with the iPhone 5 I purchased from you.  It was in excellent condition. I am really enjoying it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughters bought these and they were delivered yesterday.  Both came with hazing on the screen that the AT&T service rep said would only get worse.  One works fine, but the other had the battery die today and it will not re-charge.  My daughter is so disappointed!  $150 is a lot of money for a child and she earned it herself.  Plus, this was to replace her old phone so we went to AT&T and got everything switched and all of her apps downloaded only for this to happen.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!  I am just hoping for an easy return process...",1.0 out of 5 stars

"It arrived in perfect condition and I had no trouble getting it ""up and running"" and my old cell phone data into it.  I like very much the camera too as I never used mine on my old cell (3).",5.0 out of 5 stars

The phone was in great condition turned on and work in initially as expected but then again glitches turn off without any kind of warning however it was returned it easily without any kind of problem which I believe is a plus for the vendor so I rated it at least a 4 star,4.0 out of 5 stars

"The battery on this phone is a dud. I can only use the phone for short intervals without it being plugged in. The buyer bought this phone for my Christmas present, which means I've only been using it for 6 months. Now I see it is too late to return it or exchange it, I'm disappointed. I would really like an exchange.",5.0 out of 5 stars
