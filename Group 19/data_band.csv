- The reason to purchase fitness band is to get results ......,5.0 out of 5 stars
It gives wrong BP values. I understand their could be some variance. But absolutely wrong values doesn't leave me with a positive feedback.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent product!! Very Good band for a starter!! Coaching tips are amazing the Coach keeps you continuously motivating and keep the status updated about ur Goals!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
The over all experience so far is good with the step counter and pulse rate. The best part is the free subscription and the team behind have the knowledge and help you alot in achieving the Health Goals. Please go for a normal band with subscription as that would a better idea. Goqii is unable to provide the accuracy in BP/Vitals which was the main feature being marketed here. The results of Blood Pressure are highly inaccurate. This certainly needs an improvement over current version of software.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"After I received it, it was quite a disappointment. The BP gauge is inaccurate to say the least - off by over 20 on the lower reading. And the other health information that I look for in a Fitness tracker is the Sleep pattern monitoring, which is not provided. The steps counter was accurate and the colour display attractive. But even the mode button selection was not that friendly nor was the instruction guide. I see there are so many 5* & 4* reviews for this product, maybe my expectations are different. So do try it, but make sure if you do not like it, return quickly - I missed that too!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Good product for it price, however i would like to see following limitations removed to score it higher",3.0 out of 5 stars
"First day I didn't feel impresssed of this product. When I started connecting with app things changed reverse . I got more excited on the reminders and coach guidance. Motivation is amazing also my coach read my food logs , exercise logs and advice me regularly . Best product I bought so far in my list",5.0 out of 5 stars
"It’s very good buy ,",5.0 out of 5 stars
This is the second band which I exchanged coz the previous one was damaged. Yet again I don't feel it's brand new as I can see a crack mark below the left corner. And the seal was previously broken with cellophane tape wrapped on it. Totally dissatisfied with this product n Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars
"What I love the most about GOQii is the eco system where it’s the whole community of people who love fitness, quite an engaging and interactive platform. Blood pressure monitor is a great revolution in a fitness band. A big thumbs up to the GOQii team,",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Its a good to have gadget for fitness loving people. Gives good information about steps covered, sleep, & heart rate. Can be worked upon a bit for more accurate blood pressure details. It would have been a better deal if extra strap been provided along with the original band.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"after usage of 1 month, following are the observed pros & cons of this device",3.0 out of 5 stars
Value for money .great Deal .,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The basic purpose of any fitness band is to approximately track your daily activities which most of the mass products easily do. The question comes then, why GOQii?? ...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A goal oriented approach to health management. Along with the product, you'll need a little determination and disciple. I've been losing a kilo a week gor the past 8 weeks. Thanks to small changes to lifestyle, measured at the right intervals, along an encouraging coach. Pretty happy with the results.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not working properly,Blood pressure results are not adequate,due to this giving tension.So I want to return but return windows is closed within 10 days after delivery instead time one month,this is a cheating with customer.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Good fitness tracker at reasonable price , many features like 💓 rate , steps, BP, sleep monitor which are more helpful for daily routine.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not as expected. I received a damaged non working band. Then I ordered for replacement. After I received the replacement, then I tried to connect to my mobile, it asked for activation code. Even though you don't want the personal coaching and want to use the band still you need to activate the membership. This is cumbersome. Also I didn't like the display. Does not look classy. I returned the replacement order as well. Mi band 3 is better than this and price is also same.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"It is an awesome activity tracker. It has made me follow healthy eating habits. The motivation it gives is ultimate. I am able to exercise and walk on a daily. No excuse, no fatigue. Hats off to you GoQii. 😊🙌",5.0 out of 5 stars
Using this product fron 2 months. Product is awesome. Coaching which comes with the product helps you to achieve your goals.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Average quality and accuracy, only reason I think is the coaching plan. But after purchasing it, I came to know that we can link other trackers to Thier app, so this one is not needed. Coaching plan also depends upon coaches, the one I got initially wasn't good, but i realised it after 4 months when I changed coach due to some issue with earlier one,I noticed this new one is a real coach who is really interested in my fitness and goal, so this 4 star is because of that new coach only, otherwise it would have been 2 to 3 max. One thing which I didn't knew earlier and that matteres to me was that you can have verbal communication only after 15 days as per policy, and coaches and experts take it very seriously if you schedule calls earlier like 10 days, even if you miss few calls on schedule.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I have been using the band for about 5-6 months now. Here is an honest review:,2.0 out of 5 stars
"An excellent watch for this prize. Stylish watch with bright screen and accurate heart rate measurement. I noticed two issues: one, the watch keeps disconnecting to connect it again, I need to clear Bluetooth catch; two, the blood pressure measurement is not accurate as it only shows low pressure even after the workout. Otherwise one of the best available in the market today!",4.0 out of 5 stars
loved the design and aesthetics. was eagerly awaiting the launch and derived utmost satisfaction once got this new GOQii vital band. Thanks for motivating me towards a healthy lifestyle.,5.0 out of 5 stars
The other details were accurate. But issue I faced was blood pressure. It showed 121/64 and less on other two instance . But measured manually and with other digital device it was not the one as stated by band. Error was more than permissible.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Review After 3 months,2.0 out of 5 stars
Really disappointed with GOQii. I had a great impression on GOQii since im using GOQii v2. With that impression I bought GOQii vital and i am sorry to say that the reading if GOQii vital is really wrong. I didn’t even wore that watch and it was showing I already walked 60 steps. Next is the Blood Pressure (Bp) its not giving the correct reading. Im telling this because i have manual BP machine. Sad to return it and not going to use GOQii anymore unless they update it,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Worst product, it even not deserve 1 star. I am order it to gift. Received watch failed to charge, dispaly was not working. Successful y got replaced  with in 2 days..G8 service and support of Amazon. Replaced watch didn't run 48 he and stop working  ..again tanks to Amazon support and refund policy, which help to get back my hardcore money. Earlier I have bought Mi3, no issue with it. Ba naam baday darshan khotay. Goqii, there is no point to provide karma point, coach and so so if this China made band is not up to the mark.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I have been using this Vital wristband. I use it to measure heart rate and blood pressure along with steps I walked. I take all these measurements literally without examining accuracy. In fact, I don’t know how accurate this wristband is for above mentioned uses. This wristband is not FDA approved. Period. However, I wear it in day times and enjoy using it. This is just a fitness band and not a medical device. So, measure your Blood Pressure and Heart Rate and keep it for the sake of keeping it. It has no real value! Enjoy your steps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I purchased this band yesterday. Upon opening it first time there were already 3000 odd steps calculated in it. How is it possible ?,1.0 out of 5 stars
There's a serious trouble with the charging unit. Even the replacement band stopped charging on second charge.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not satisfied with the product. Doesn't give correct reading of steps shows one reading in the app and different in the tracker, time format keeps changing from 12hr to 24hr, Sleep tracking doesn't work properly. Frequent connection issue with Bluetooth connection. Overall very disappointed",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Compared to similarly priced Mi band, GoQii band is very poor, inaccurate and counts false steps. Even distance travelled sitting in a vehicle is counted as 'steps', random number of steps get added even of you are sitting in one place and doing nothing , which makes this band hopelessly inaccurate and useless.",1.0 out of 5 stars
The main advantage of Goqii is that it focuses on the main thing that a fitness lifestyle requires. Commitment to a healthier lifestyle and motivation to keep doing it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Nice Coaching and good band.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Some problem with the Seller Cloudtail...delivered first one with used scratch card...replacement done with a faulty one with battery lasting for 12 hours only...finally GOQII replaced the machine...working good now...approximately 4 days of battery life,3.0 out of 5 stars
"GOQI is one of the best bands I have experienced. The best facility is free coaching which is really amazing. Easy sync of step.count, sleep data, heart rate and colour display is fantastic. The step count and sleep data is is accurate. Charging is easy and faster.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Pros:,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Blur free colour display. Brightness is good enough for use it in sun light. Step count and heart rate measurements are high accurate. But the best thing is coaching. Expert personal coach is always available, who can give a good diet and training plan which helps to stay fit and track your fitness as well. Goqii health store is awesome, healthy food to fitness accessories are available with good discounted price.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I recently purchased this device. I have always heard a lot about GOQII, but honestly I am disappointed. There are few things I'd like to point out -",2.0 out of 5 stars
"The display is great, the vitals are helpful and the best part, it tracks our sleep and tells us how our sleep pattern has been.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great product! Value for money. Vitals are accurately recorded. The app provides a complete fitness ecosystem as compared to other fitness bands,4.0 out of 5 stars
Battery back up is nice. Step counting is not accurate but it is ok. One more thing goqii should improve is automatic BP and heart rate monitoring as it becomes irritating after few days to measure manually. Google fit is also missing. It shoud connect with google fit data  display quality should be inproved. Live video is the best feature which i liked.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Look : Nice. Comfort Wearable. Steps, Heart rate showing proper. Blood Pressure absolute WRONG. Lower always shown around 60-65. How's is it possible!!!!! Customer support said it shall be perfect after firmware update. But, no update and still showing wrong. Further, no response from customer support.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Great product to keep track of fitness with support provided with the app to follow a healthy lifestyle. Worth it if getting fit is your aim.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Received same defective piece twice. The band is nice but if you are giving used and defective (scratch Mark in bottom part) products in the name of sale then it's not ok,1.0 out of 5 stars

I purchase this product on last week.,3.0 out of 5 stars
I find the tracker extremely useful  as it reminds me at regular intervals to get up and walk and reach the target of 7 km daily.(Which I have set for myself).Besides this I also have the benefit of monitoring my B.P/Heart rate.To top it all I get the advice of fitness experts.I have been using this tracker(Vital) for the past 3months.,4.0 out of 5 stars
It app look like an ad page. Lot of advertisement. They forgot the purpose of the band . Very difficult to moniter the activities. Application lost connection to the band very frequently.

"I like the design efficiency, but still the company has to improve customer care support when ever they say they'll mail regarding the complaint they don't send mails!. Am using the new vital band the step count is counted even driving or travelling in bus since I travel four hours a day nearly 5000 to 6000 steps is getting counted daily which is very bad!!! Regarding the app also it is still not clear. Not friendly, only i can see they are promoting many food items.which i don't need!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
This has been a most disappointing experience. The first piece I got did not switch on. The replacement device was charged and worn for a few days. Once the battery ran out - it was plugged into my laptop USB to charge - it simply does not work. It doesn't charge. it doesn't come on either.  When it was in use - the only feature i found useful was the pedometer - which can be substituted by any mobile app ! The BP readings were far too low and are no where even remotely close to my actual BP levels. This purchase has been a big mistake.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Good product with a week's battery life. First time it went on for 2 days but from next charge onwards giving almost a week's worth . Coach are great and keep track of your performance and give suggestions as well to improve your health and fitness,5.0 out of 5 stars
"When I searched for perfect Fitness activity tracker through online research and with reviews, I found GOQii came up with L1 both in Price and Technical. But immediately after purchase what was impressed me a lot is their Coaching facility to encourage you to get FIT with proper guidance and Doctor on call which will make you definitely to get fit with some target. I appreciate the whole GOQii team for their initiative to make India better with Fitness... Go for it guys instead of paying to Hospitals...",4.0 out of 5 stars
"It's a Fantastic device or rather best word would be program, This device is not a time keeper its a health monitor, sorry not health monitor but health maker. initially i just thought some smart watch but my perception changed quickly with regular health monitoring by nutritionist on my water, food, sleep, healthy diet intake. expert doctors query solving, health videos, experienced user who had changed their sedentary lifestyle to healthy and Fit lifestyle.  live with their experience. its been am awesome experience truly, Thanks Goqii its just not a device but health in total which we  definitely miss in our day to day life. i would also add to people who have joined gym, for them its a parameter to healthy way monitoring  without injury, yoga and other training, mind blowing stuff.  Its a serious product one should have,",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Have been a Goqii ""Player"" off and on literally since the beginning. This is by far the best band to come out of their stables !

"What I liked the most about this GOQii band which I purchased after a lot of research is the ecosystem that it provides. The hardware is pretty good and it's easy to charge since we needn't carry an extra cable, but the head itself can be directly plugged into any USB port. The next thing I liked about GOQii vital is that it can be worn even during swimming.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Good band with color display. Little difficult to connect with app. Charging is very tecnical and with lead to breakage of watch overtime or loosening of strap as have to pull out the strap to connect with USB charger. Been 2 days using it. Gets auto disconnected. Feels little girlish. Lots of things to do in app. Gets personal coaching and diet chart.,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I have been on the GOQii platform since it started 3.5 years ago. From V1 to V2 and now I have upgraded to GOQii Vital.  I got my GOQii Vital on Amazon prime Day at a great introductory price. And I am so happy with the new tracker. I have not done many reviews on GOQii but Vital I thought merits a review. It's sleek as compared the other two bands that I have had. It's easy to use as well.  Even if the user manual is not there it is easy to use and self-explanatory. So I read through the description in detail before I bought it and after I got the band on 18th July, I also spoke to the support team at GOQii and got my band easily activated. One of the interesting features is that unlike my previous 2 cores where it would start with a 'TAP', Vital you need to swipe from the plus sign downwards. I found the touch and swipe feature convenient as against a tap.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have been huawei's honor band 3 user for a long time. This is my second fitness band. I really like this band but there is one thing which is really annoying and needs improvement. This one thing is raise to wakeup feature. It's really slow. It takes 1-2 second to wakeup the screen after raising the wrist completely. Most of the times it doesn't even work. It can be easily fixed via a software patch.,4.0 out of 5 stars

To my surprise the new replacement device also turns out to be defective hence I applied straight for refund. Who wants to take risk by wearing such risky tracker that can stop workin at anytime. If their new devices are giving such issues m sure it won't last a year even if it works at start.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I am not sure if this product is tested before its launch. I have used 2 vital trackers still there was error in steps counting and second tracker had battery issues in addition. Also some of the fuctions like date format and sleep monitoring was not properly working. Atleast step counts should be accurate, while sitting in car this tracker would count 500-700 steps without any movement at all. I dont know if heart rate or BP monitering is accurate or not as simple step counting was not even correct.",2.0 out of 5 stars

it doesnt track anything unless you check that specific option...i.e. if you run without checking the run option then the stupid band does not even show an increased heart rate (that is incredibly stupid).....same for every activity...and oh...on top of it if you make a complaint they dont even bother responding.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Giving 5 stars based on delivery by amazon and looks + connectivity of the watch.will review again after a month for battery life.also some reviews mentioned bp is not accurate...it will never be..it can only give an idea and for step count it is damn accurate.. a fair deal in INR 1800,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I am writing this review after using the Goqii band and their services for the last 18 months. I started with their earlier version of tracker and now upgraded to this latest version VITAL which is having colour display, Bllod pressure measurement and tracking your various activities like running, workouts and cycling. My experience with Goqii is one of a very positive change in my life not only a weight reduction of 20 kg in 18 months but also a very active and healthy life, Eventhough we may have the determination to lead a healthy way of life without any external inducement, a little push towards the right direction will go long way in attaining our goal in a safe and faster pace. Goqii is one such push with its relentless coaching and guidance and doctor consultation and numerous video guides. The latest addition of interactive video guides through the app is a delight to watch where you can clarify your doubts then and there with expert fitness coaches, nutritionists and doctors. If you are interested in leading a healthy life you need proper guidance and Goqii is one such service and an excellent one and there is no parallel . GO FOR IT without any hesitation, you will be certainly happy with your decision.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Got carried away by newspaper articles about the product, particularly the blood pressure monitor and exaggerated reviews. Purchased at ₹ 2999/- in lightning deal. Used for 5 days. Very dissatisfying experience. Initially there was lot of difficulty in connecting the band with Goqii app. Battery life is poor, doesn’t last beyond  2 days. Steps counts keep on shooting even for small activity. Blood pressure monitor is an amazing technology but it is not accurate & cannot be depended upon particularly by BP patients who want to monitor regularly. Band keeps on getting auto-disconnected from Goqii app on iphone & needs to be re-connected by switching ‘off & on’ bluetooth multiple times a day. Charging requires taking off the band straps and then connecting to USB charger & is very inconvenient. Colour display is good. Messages/calls are indicated on band.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Goqii has built an amazing ecosystem with Coaches, Doctors and Experts and has the potential to be a great product but it still isn't there. At this point I have just been taking help from the Coach that they provide, it is just a high level guidance about how to make small changes in your life in terms of habits, while I think it is a good idea but I would not want to pay for such common sense guidance that I l already know.

Quality of the tracker is okay. I can see space on the side from where water or sweat can easily enter. The product has a coloured display which is good. It also has bp monitor that is good enough not perfect. Step count is accurate. But the band has sync issues and the app is not good at all. All they are trying to do is sell you stuff on the app which is not why anyone  buys the band. The coaching feature is unique might even help some people but it is not for everyone. I suggest go for another brand with good app support and quality tracker.,2.0 out of 5 stars

"I have been on goqii since 2 years and I must say that Goqii Vital is their finest product. The acuaracy, build quality and every other aspect of the fitness tracker has been improved from previous bands. One thing those who are facing issue with bp monitor, just place your hand on table at heart level while measufing the blood pressure. It is the standard way of measuring bp with digital machines.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"We ordered two of this between me and my brother and found the same issues with both. The only good thing about this is the coach feature, the coach spent good time over the call understanding the goal and provided the solution and followed up with notes and habits. I was lucky to get a good coach but my brother's coach was not as responsive as mine.",1.0 out of 5 stars
