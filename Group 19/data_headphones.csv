Thanks Amazon for the freedom sale or else I would never have considered to buy these headphones.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Comfortable to wear.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Pros,4.0 out of 5 stars
-First of all it is not worth the price,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I am ok in this special edition, its not up to the original branded value... also phone calls are unclear... many times I used to avoid headphones for calls... battery performance is good as compared to main edition of 4.5 BT SERIES. For high bass songs sound quality is not good..",3.0 out of 5 stars
"this heeadphone work perfectly with mobile phones but problem with laptop . If you want to buy Sennheiser HD 4.50,  I suggest you  to buy original not special edition. I am tying special edition 2 times. all the times have same issues,, beware friends.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Can't wear it more than 2 hours at a stretch or so, sometimes it becomes uncomfortable on ears & feels heavy. The sound is not very great as per price but it's good enough. Noise activation is difficult to activate on Bluetooth mode and easy on wired. Battery life is good, I charge it weekly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have bought this product on 24 October 2018. Till now its work good but now for no reason its not working, first of all it stuck on ON state, no function is working in it. I tried to switch off it but that is not working either. So i connect it to laptop to switch off it. i thought it will work after getting off than i tried to ON it but now its look like its dead. and the main thing i haven't notice when i bought this is that there is no service center in Delhi, i have to travel to Gurgaon to repair it........",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I liked it when I got an almost ₹15K (₹14990) product at 50% Off in one of the Sales and icing on the cake was another 10% instant cashback. So, practically the product cost me ₹6741/- only. The HD 4.40 is available in ₹7.5K anyways. The only improved or additional feature that company talks about is Noise Cancellation, which is missing in HD 4.40. When you are listening to Music, the NC feature still works fine, but, during calls the Noise Cancellation feature doesn't works at all in noisy backgrounds. You literally have to remove the headset and shout out in the mic of the headset for the person to hear what you are talking. Battery is awesome. I am saying that as I have used the headset majorly for listening music while i am commuting. It has given me more than a weeks runtime at time. But, i believe if you use it continuously, it should give you atleast 2 days of run time. Durability wise I had read in some other review that the cushions are not great for long music sessions. Somewhat that statement is correct. The headphones start hurting if you wear it for too long. In my personal experience, it makes the section around your ears warm (probably because they are covered and no ventilation is happening) and starts sweating after around 15 mins of continuous music listening. The logo prints on the sides were printed so shallow that they vanished after around 2 months on usage.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The overall product quality and sound is excellent...But the authenticity of the product is questionable since its packaged in a brown coloured box with a qr code from Appario Retail Private Ltd instead of the Senheiser branded box...Can anyone help me regarding this?,5.0 out of 5 stars
Very worst prouct from Sennheiser. Didnt expect such kind of quality. Its not compatible with all devices. Its not comfortable to wear for long. No good bass or no better clear sound. Except noise cancellation nothing it has got. Sound quality is worse than my other normal earphones. Only noise cancelling is something useful otherwise it's waste of money. Packing is also cheap snd also when i exchanged for a new one no accessories were given. It came in a damaged box.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Got this product for my brother. He absolutely loved it. The performance of Noise cancellation is absolutely brilliant. Its even better than Sony h.ear NC Wireless(100-ABN) model, which I primarily use, although the sound in Sony is more fuller.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these at a sale for 7,500 rupees. These have very good noise cancelling and a laid back sound signature, which is something I like. They aren't bass heavy and are very balanced. I have a pair of wired Bose QC2s and boy has sound cancelling come a long way. The Bose are good but these are phenomenal.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is very good. If you've been using cheaper headphones till now, this will be a noticeable upgrade. Battery life and WiFi range are very good. NC is fine. Not as good as Bose or higher end Sony, but absolutely great for normal usage in trains or offices.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have tried the models, PMX60, CX180, CX275 on Sennheiser and I must admit that HD 4.50BTNC is the worst of all. Its not worth even 1500 INR but is out in the market for 15,000 INR which is 10x times more than CX 275 which is very durable with a great sound in terms of the bass and voice eq.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Noise cancellation = 3/10,3.0 out of 5 stars
Just received the headphone after two of my friends already bought.,5.0 out of 5 stars
What's good you can find anywhere.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not discoverable by a Bluetooth device most of the times. This is my first day of usage of these headphones. Also,the customer support is pathetic and the customer executive when I asked him to place a return request for me.These can only be replaced and not returned as per him...so please buy them at your own risk.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This one I bought for my daughter .. I loved this one after I tested once in Dubai and I liked it at the first sight. And it was in my wish list for a while.. Real noise cancellation head-phone. My daughter really enjoys the clarity and sound quality ..  Battery life is pretty good and I haven't tried, my daughter told she can use wire when the battery is down. She took it in the recent college trip and she told the battery was good enough for 4 days of her trip and 10 hrs of usage daily",5.0 out of 5 stars
I received a defective product & it seems to be a duplicate product. Very bad sound & not contenting with wire. Packing dosent look like a sennheiser original one. Applied for replacement of product.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"First of all, note that i made this purchase for half the price during the great indian sale. Secondly, the headphone isn't worth 15k. Now keeping that in mind, this headphone is an absolute beast. The sound quality is really good.....you get that sennheiser classic sound with clear vocals, gread mids and highs, and a punchy bass. It isn't made for bass lovers. I'm a person who prefers decent bass. Sadly the same sound isn't reproduced to this extent when you use the headphone as a wired one(yes they give a 3.5mm cable, a usb 2.0 and a travel pouch in the box). The headphone produces it's best sound only if it's connected wirelessly but i like the option of using it as a wired one too. Battery life is decent, i get anywhere between 28 hours to 36 hours when i use it frequently(again it depends on individual use and preference) with the noise cancellation turned on. And noise cancellation is decent too. Definitely not on Bose level or sony or any other headphones which cost more than 15k. The build feels cheap but flexible and the ear cushions are soft and comfy. Sound can be a little low and has to be atleast 60%-70% to get that great sound. NFC is great! I just tap my phone to the headphone and it gets connected instantly. And the music listening for long hours doesn't hurt either. I listen to EDMs(Trap, Drumstep, Dubstep, House, Future Bass) , pop music as well as aesthetic one like the works of conposers like Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman. Overall this is worth the price if you purchase it for 7.5k(wait for a sale). These are the best wireless consumer headphones under 10k in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I liked sound signature, it was balanced with apt bass mids and highs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
It has amazing battery life very good sound quality.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I got this product for a great deal. The sound quality is really good. I had tried a few online tests, and it was in par with most of the good headphones. The battery life is amazing, something I really loved. The active noise cancellation isn't the best, but best for the price. The Bose headphones are lighter and much comfortable than this, but then they cost you a fortune. The controls are intuitive, except to enable noise cancellation.",5.0 out of 5 stars
The biggest downside of this product is its comfort. I have a smaller than average face and still can’t wear this on for more than 15-20mins as the cups are too hard on your ears.,1.0 out of 5 stars
The noise cancellation on this is almost non existent. It just reduces white noise (things like fan sound etc) a little. All other things are clearly audible and not reduced at all.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Everything is great in it except the bass, it is lacking here. But you will forget it when u will the listen to the sound quality and clarity. Mids and highs are awesome. Voice quality is crystal clear. Noise Cancelation works. Battery life is awesome. It is comfortable for long hours for people with small ears like me, but it is not that much comfortable for people with big ears. Materials used all plastic but a high quality plastic in which u can depend. I got in sale at a price of 7.5k, at this price it is unresistable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sound quality is good but noice cancellation is not some out of the world kind of experience yes it does work.. battery life is great hands down... doesn’t really dies once fully charges impressive... the feel n material used seems durable.. knocked it already a couple of times not a scratch... it is easy n comfortable to wear isn’t painful even after wearing for hours...carrying pouch shud have been more durable,4.0 out of 5 stars
What a steal at 50% discount for the wonderful product. Connection to devices for the first time is bit problematic but once you sort that then it is great sound. Should have some display on the headset or the app which would make life easy. CapTune on Android has problems downloading. On Apple devices it was easy.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Got it on sale for 7.5k. As everyone already mentioned in reviews, noise cancelling isn't that great, but good enough to cut down outside noise like 85-90%. Sound is good enough too. Agreed that bass could have been better with this sized drivers. Pretty satisfied with the product for the money I spent.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the original price of 14k. It's marginally ok of you get it for  a discount, I got it for 7.5k. sound quality is passable. Not very comfortable to wear for long listening sessions. One major concern for me is that it keeps getting disconnected!! and clicks when I listen via Bluetooth. Could't connect via NFC eithet. Beware of buying this product.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"This is Good Product but i think sound quality of Skullcandy Headsets are more dynamic, clear and deliver good Bass effects. Like Skullcandy Crusher is less expensive than this product, but delivers very good quality of sound, especially for Bass lovers and for all those who would like to use their BT Headsets with their Bid Screen LCD/LEDs for watching Movies.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The product is great. Sound quality is wonderful.  Slight Hussle in initial understanding of the controls.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is one of the nicest sounding headphones I have used till date. The audio output is more or less flat, which means that this is not meant for bass lovers. The flat sound profile provides enough room for you to enjoy the mids, lows and highs with ease. The cushioning is also quite good, though I feel the grip in the head could have been a little weaker. Battery life is also superb and if you are light user, th battery will last you for a few days if you are using these regularly for 2 hours a day. Overall, good buy",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The product though mentions over-ear, fits more like an on ear headphone.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Probably one of the worst headphones that you can buy for this very price .The item arrived and I was excited about it .and the moment I put them on and started streaming songs ,it was one of the worst experience. The volume at full bar is low .I even tried changing the EQ but it didn’t make any difference . The active noise cancellation was even worse . Didn’t make any difference . I bought them for 8.5k and now I have to go through hurdle of my refund . DO NOT GO FOR THIS HEADPHONE . Waste of money .",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought it for a discounted price at 7,500 appr. But it feels 7.5 K is even expensive for this headphone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I feel it is not at all comfortable for long hour listening. Pressure on sides is very much there. You will start feeling uncomfortable after 30 mins or so. Soft padding on headband is  very minimal and not helpful. Though sound and build quality both are good in this price range.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This 4.50 has been getting good reviews for a Noise cancellation headphone...and with the Amazon sale, got it for a great price of 7.5k. Ear pads are a little small for over-the-ear...but not a deal-breaker...great vfm....highly recommended.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Good sound quality and battery life... However, nose cancellation is sub par and head phones are not as comfortable for long usages... Especially for people with bigger ears.... However, considering the price as compared to the gold standard on this in the market, it's good value for money and suffices the need....",3.0 out of 5 stars
"The product is superb in terms of durability abd battery backup. The sound quality is very good but not the best in that segment. I would say the sound is quite balanced. However the mic is a let down. The Noise Cancellation is also very good. I got it for 7.5k, so if anyone is getting it for the same price just buy it and don't give a second thought. However 15k is way too high for this.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Very good Audio quality, Good low frequency response, Battery lasts longer and charges quickly as well,",5.0 out of 5 stars
Noise cancellation for which I purchased is not effective. You can hear the aircraft drone to drown which the volume has to be pumped up which is what I didn't want. Sound quality is good with blue tooth but poor with audio cord. Could not figure out the 3 steps noise cancellation. It is either on or off.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Yeah is a kind ok Okey product,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I am just blown away by the product quality and performance, what a headphone! The nose cancellation is top notch and you will see a perceptible reduction in nose the moment you switch the headphone on. I have been using it for the last 5 days and I just can't stop smiling everytime I use it. Just close your eyes and go for it, it can't get any better than this",5.0 out of 5 stars
Good sound. The cups could have been a bit bigger. Uncomfortable after half an hour.,4.0 out of 5 stars
This headphone has excellent sound quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazing Sound. Sounds like a theater with Dolby Atmos on you PC. One dealbreaker is that the plastic ear cups will start creaking at the joints in a month. Even the slightest movement of you jaw and the your hear creaky pops. Silicone lubrications may help. But maybe the piece I received. Get a hard carry case to extend longevity.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"It’s not a bang for your buck, sound is good not the best in business considering these(and price), sennheiser logo started fading after several uses that made me question for it’s quality. Test, try and then buy here if you wish to (considering 50% off amazon gives you sometimes)",4.0 out of 5 stars
It's a decent headphone for the price that it is available at..cherry on the top is the decent ANC that it offers..if you get it for 8-9k buy it without thinking twice..yes the sound leaks a bit at high volume.but you should try loading the bass EQ app..the sound quality really amplifies after that,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Perfect headphones for sound lovers but not for bass lovers , these heDphones are for mild music listners not to loud , noice cancellation is good go for it if you want to buy but not at price of 15000 whenever there is discount buy at that time i bought for 7500 in amazon great india festival.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser's product for this price is amazing.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Great at the price of 7.5k, noise cancelling is adequate not like high end bose or sony. But great for day to day use. Serves the purpose. Great battery life and sound quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Quality of sound is good, if not great. But it's an absolute sucker at comfort. If you use it even for 20-30 minutes, your ears would start aching. Noise cancellation effect is also good. Overall 3/5.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Everything is good in the headphones,1.0 out of 5 stars
TL;DR,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Noice Cancellation is decent in normal situations like home use and city travel, higher-end headphones perform better in flights and very crowded areas. Also I wish the overall volume feels low but it may be due to a setting on my smartphone which I need to recheck. Great sound overall and can tune the EQ to your liking.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Sound quality is pretty good battery life and time is awsm  approx 20 hrs,  some times its cause technical issue in Bluetooth",4.0 out of 5 stars
Pathetic quality for such price. Got it replaced once but the replaced piece is also of similar quality.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Low ends cracks all the time due to defective piece and amazon didn't let me return the product,1.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased just because of the name but it’s quality is not up to mark as per brand value because This is HD SE BT 4.5 not HD BT 4.5... special addition for amazon sound quality is decent sound is cracking on Bass... sonot for bass lovers... have to face some Problem to connect overall good but not up to mark in this price range,3.0 out of 5 stars

Very bass heavy also audio is not that clear,3.0 out of 5 stars
The product is ok. Doesn't do justice with the price. Sound quality is not very good and also not very bad. Also they are too heavy. Not at all comfortable if you want to wear it for a longer time.  Better headphones are available in this price range.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Not the best noise cancellation but does a decent job. Sound quality is very balanced. Ear cups could have been bigger and more comfortable. That's the only gripe.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Good quality headphones with excellent noise-cancellation. Only issue is that they are bit on the heavier side and are uncomfortable to wear in hot weather (probably the case with all bluetooth headphones),4.0 out of 5 stars
A mod level of sound cancellation coupled with good sound and zero wire hassels. All these within a modest price bracket.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Comprehensive Review - Used everyday for 15 Days,2.0 out of 5 stars
Writing this review after two weeks...,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I had been waiting for an affordable product in comparison to Bose QC and Sony's noise cancellation head phones. The Sennheiser HD noise cancellation head phones have the right mix of frequencies, a decent cancellation paradigm, a good battery life of around 20 hours, and an excellent wearing comfort. I did not come across the discomfort reported by some user over the ears or the jaw area. Even though it may not have the highest output in terms of volume, the sound quality is decent and represents the lows, mids, and high appropriately. I would certainly recommend this product and seller too, for a prompt well-packaged delivery.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I was the first one who ordered it on sale and then it got out of stock but it again came back.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Noise cancellation is good and active noise guard is really nice for use in busy and noisy places,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Was looking for a wireless headset for a while. This is sort of audiphile grade. Love the sound quality. The clarity and mids and lows  are spectacular. I love how the bass is subtle and not overpowering.  Durability is almost perfect. Ergonomics and quality of the buttons are not good. It is reasonably comfortable for 1-2 hours at a stretch. Not as comfortable as the Bose QC 35.  Good headphones for work or to chill. Battery life is great, connectivity is great and does the job well. The noise cancellation is mild at best. Thanks to these headphones I have started listening to a lot of alternative rock.",4.0 out of 5 stars
So i had been waiting for these headphones for a while as I bought these as a birthday gift...,4.0 out of 5 stars

Great pair of headphones. Good battery life. Adequate noise canceling. Sound quality is quite good as well. No issues in connectivity.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The headphones are great, but they are definitely bulky and seem to get uncomfortable after 30-40 mins of use. The only good competition to this is Bose QC35 - the price of which can buy you two of these headphones. All in all, NFC, pairing, sound quality is all top class; bulkiness being the only con.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Volume is pathetic ...beats or bass is just not there ...my Samsung ear phones performance so much better than  this headset....please don't waste your money on this.  .greatly disappointed.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Sound quality is lower than Sennheiser signature standard but still is better than many products in the price category, however, the biggest drawback is the headband design and the pressure exerted on the ears ! Alas the headband cushioning is inadequate and the band width in the higher end cans is generally twice of this and with better cushioning for longer listening sessions. The pressure in this design on the ears and the adjoining sections is surely more than required, coming close to irritable levels after a short session - probably in the effort to improve noise suppression but this is backfiring as the cans can only be used for about 30 mins and then your ears start crying to take these off. Hopefully Sennheiser can take some corrective action to address this fault to make it a worthy Sennheiser which at present it fails to comply with.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"DO NOT buy these for their noise cancellation. Doesn't work, rather just adds a strange hiss to the sound. At best it is noise isolation headphone. This is my second unit of the same SKU - both failed miserably in this aspect. Sound quality varies from OK to good, depending upon the type of music. It's never spectacular though. Battery life is good. Initial pairing can be a pain sometimes. Pixel 2 XL pairing was a breeze, OnePlus 6 just wouldn't connect. Buy these if available on a discount - as a decent enough bluetooth headphone - not as a noise cancelling one though. You get what you pay for.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic Sound Quality! Amazon has this product at half price during Independence Day sale, came in early too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
What a deal.. Good brand with good sound and decent noise cancellation.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Yes the product is as per what it claimed..,5.0 out of 5 stars
Best in its class. Especially with amazing offers from Amazon. I've had my share of headphones. Couldn't resist checking this out after the price and deals offered. Noice canceling is as good as bose itself. Earmuffs are big but I like it that way. Nice leather finishing with metal and plastic covering gives it class and agility. I'd say definitely a fantastic buy. I still haven't had the charge fully run out. I always travel with it. Five stars and double thumbs up 👍👍,5.0 out of 5 stars
Overall a good overhead ANC headphone.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is obviously Sennheiser quality, one of the best.....crisp and true to the music. I have to say im a bit disappointed with the noise cancelling but considering that it comes at the almost $100 cheaper than the Bose or any of its competitors id definitely say its a good buy and kudos to Amazon for the quick delivery and response.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"As MRP is ₹14,990 , someone would expect there should be some use of metal in the product. It's totally plastic. Quite comfortable. I don't find kind of difficulties while using the product. Little bit confusing how to enable/disable ANC . Bluetooth range is quite good. As per my test Sound quality is totally balanced. I have purchased this through Amazon freedom sale with super discount",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Simply Amazing Music Reproduction. I am comparing the sound quality with Audio Technica and Bose headphones, which I own. But these can reproduce the most balanced music, in wired or bluetooth mode. Two hours of charge gives me more than 12 hours of continuous listening in bluetooth mode. The ANC is not even 50% of what Bose QC 35 can deliver. It is just enough kill ambient sounds and engine drone. Though the Phone earpads are very well made, they can never cover my ears completely and acts as on the Ear phones rather than Over the ear. The padding on the band is flimsy and using the phones for longer period becomes uncomfortable. The Bose QC 35 and Audio Technica with its large earpads and good padding win when it comes to comfort. But again if I have to buy another set of Headphones, simply to listen to music, I will buy these Sennheisers again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Great sound and perfect balance bass is not on high end but clarity of sound  is best,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Nothing less than the title...simply superb cans...I spent sleepless nights reading number of reviews n am on the verge of buying Sennheiser Momentum wireless 2.0  and fortunately came across these cans which are exactly half or even less cost than momentum...but to tell you,I made a right choice by choosing these,as they are just like IN THE STUDIO... especially,their soundstage and SEPARATION are mind blowing,along with excellent sound balance... don't get doubtful by reading few reviews speaking about their BASS capabilities,these are just outstanding in BASS segment..if someone wants the FAKE BASS produced by SONYs,let god bless!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
The noise cancellation is not as good as expected. The price is although justified..,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Sound quality is good however, noise cancelation is preety ordinary. U don’t get a sennheiser”s feel on your ears. Baterry life is awesome and with this kinda ANC price is a bit high. When put on cable you loose all the controls on the headset which means no NC, no colume, no track change.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"brought this for 7.5k and I must say it is worth every penny at that price point. the noise cancellation, however, is not as good as high-end headphones but still pretty good. In no sale situation, one can also go for 4.40BT which just lacks noise cancellation and wouldn't miss much.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Writing this review after an extensive use close to a month now. I’ve been using Sennheiser products close to a decade now, the sound quality is really good, I love flat music & it meets my requirement, those bass lovers look somewhere else. Coming to active noise cancelling, it does to some extent, while traveling/commute especially we all Indians know how good the roads are here, it adds it’s own disturbance, it’s good when you are at office or home sitting listening music or movie. Battery is excellent, connectivity is good. Switching on, sometimes take multiple push. If you are thinking to take calls from this, think twice if you are in crowd, it’s not that other person can’t hear you, that person can hear everyone else along with your’s, as this doesn’t have a noise cancelling microphone. Overall not bad if you are at home, office are somewhere calm, which is not it’s overall purpose.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"The device in itself is great. Love the Audio quality. Only drawback, was turning the Headset Off when it was in Wireless Mode. For some reason, no matter how long, hard, soft, etc manner of ways you pressed it, there was no guarantee it would turn off. I noticed this Issue was faced mostly when the battery life was less than 6 hours. When it was above that, such occurrences were rare.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"While everything about this Sennheiser BT headphones is fantastic, there is only 1 strange problem - if you listening while walking, it creates a thump sound in the ears, and that disturbs your listening experience, and is annoying. This means that I almost cannot hear it while I am taking my walk, which is a strange situation. Otherwise everything is great about this product.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Simply put.. unbeatable in its class..Been using d brand since last 10 years and never was displeased wid quality. Now dis pair, like most of dem of dis brand offers neutral sound n I hv to tune my Equalizer to get d type of sound I want. Of course if u want audiophile grade u need to up ur budget. But wid normal ears, u'll b overwhelmed wid d details it produces@113db@1kHz@1Vrms. Bass is not overpowering, but very natural and satisfying n does not feel like out of d world as is belted out in 'some other' company's headphones, where electronic filters suppresses d mid n high frequencies to boost d low (read Bass) frequencies and claim as SUPERBASS or BASSHEADS or Head n Brain CRUSHERS..As said it has dynamic bass, I feel, it tries to adjust as much as possible to d Equalizer setting. Music is lively..More if ur source supports aptX BT codec.. if u want abnormal bass dis is not for u, as it would distort at highest volume wid highest Bass and highest Equalizer setting for LOW FREQUENCIES,since it's diaphragm is PET..In layman's terms, go for it, if u want a near-natural sound, in an Over-ear BT headset, wid balanced low mid n high frequencies sound. If ur upgrading from cheap headphones or d so-called boombassssstic trash den u'll be surprised to hear lot more instruments in it, and pleased to know dat de existed in ur music for all the time u were listening 2 dem in ur previous pairs. U'll fall in love wid dem, just as I have. Got @₹6741/- only in d gr8 freedom sale on Amazon. Thanx to Amazon for such a magical price to such a beautiful piece..I love Sennheiser..But d review was an honest one..widout any partiality..",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is excellent (crystal clear and undistorted even at the highest volume), pairing these with your device is a breeze, and the overall build quality is impressive, despite the lack of metal and real leather.

I must say, these headphones are a damn good entry level buy, in the wireless + ANC game !!

The biggest problem in wireless headphones is that they have bad battery backup but these have super long battery life.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"At this price point, they really need to work on sound quality and make it superior. My bose qc25 (wired) are atleast 10 times better in terms of sound.

Though higher at price, it would serve your purpose.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"The Headphone is a very good piece, and has a good feel of premium to it. The earcups are a bit hard on the earlobes and could impact a bit of pain to them.

"After watching a whole lot of video reviews I've been back and forth on this one as I wasn't sure if this product will impress. Fortunately, my friend bought it and his review solved all my fears and doubts. I instantly bought it and voila! The product is by far the best musical experience I've got. I'm not much of a bass lover and loves clear and crisp music and vocals with ample bass. This product is just that! With regard to comfort, it takes at least 2 weeks of usage to get comfort around this product as you may initially feel that it's too tight around your ears. But, once your past that stage, it gets comfy. Yes, I do occasionally have to take it off as it gets a bit heated up and I don't mind it.

"Bose headphones provides you noise cancellation even if music is not playing. So do not compare this to BOSE. However once the music start playing with this headphone, the noise cancellation is great. I use this in my work environment or while traveling and the outside noises are filtered out.

"With the HD 4.50BTNC, you can expect a warm clear sound with crisp highs and punchy bass that's adequate but never overpowers. For those who are after crisp audio and well-rounded tone, the HD 4.50BTNC is worth considering. Even when I cranked them all the way up, the sound remained quite clear and didn't distort.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"You can hardly go wrong with a Sennheiser.  I am no audiophile, but to me it sounds just great. Not too bassy.  Feels natural.  The headband is a bit tight, but maybe it will settle into a good fit with use.  Enabling noise cancellation is a bit tricky.  My in-ear Bose NCs are better with noise-cancelling. The Sennheisers let in a bit more of ambient.  In fact for most people the version without NC might be a better proposition.  The padded over-ear pieces by themselves block a lot of external noise.",5.0 out of 5 stars
its a worthy product in this range i suggest other to buy and enjoy the music as you want .,5.0 out of 5 stars

I have used this product for the past 1 week i feel that the audio quality is really good and sennheiser has nailed it especially when i played an 8d music i could feel the audio travelling all around me .now considering the physical overview the build quality is really good..rubber silicone is used as the padding on top of the headphone and there is not much branding in the headphone which i feel is good.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Outstanding headphones! Was eagerly waiting for them to launch in India and here they are.
