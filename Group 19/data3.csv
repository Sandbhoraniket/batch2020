Dont buy cheap quality  phone,Very dull display in sun light time . Outside  You can't view and read letters . Easily broke the touch screen. If I m using screen protector
Good One,RAM 2GB IN 10990 IS NOT JUSTIFIED WHEN REALME 2 PRO IS COMING WITH BETTER HARDWARE WITHIN THE SAME PRICE
Must buy for all,Best budget phone in market...battery life superb never went to finish up to 2 day of regular use..no  heating problems and there was no lagging issues at all face detection gives accuracy shocks in the night as it increases screen brightness to be high and detects you quickly and also the camera deserve a medal again nice combo pack in just 10000/-
Awesome smartphone with cheapest range,Oppo you beauty... Camera quality is superb and battery backup is excellent.
Very impressive,"Very very good product I'm satisfied with this product,😊😊😊"
Phone issues and Manufacturing quality.,"It takes quite a long time to charge the phone. There is touch issue in the four corners of the phone. Camera quality is not great.,The box arrived in a sealed pack condition but the seal has sentences with spelling and grammatical mistakes, which creates a doubt if it is an original product. Also, the stickers on the box like - product details, VoLte, manufacturer details are manually and poorly stuck.,The protective shield on the phone was improperly stuck, has air bubble below the shield and had fine finger print marks over it. The white box where the sim card ejector tool is fixed had fold marks which could be made out that the tool was removed multiple times from its place.,Poor manufacturing quality in India."
Super battery super sound,"I have purchased this mobile phone a month ago,,I am very much impressed with battery and camera quality within this range of mobile phone.,I was little warry about oppo as a brand ,but trust me it is worth for money."
Excellent low budget phone,"This is my comprehensive review about the OPPO A3S, 2 GB ram, 16GB ROM,1. Look seems pretty i bought red in color and it look elegant. it seems like premium smartphone.,2. when we start the phone it takes minimum time to start. it feels like butter,3. initially the processor works good when there are factory applications installed in it.,4. Screen touch is bitter less responsive but it is better for this budget.,5. Color OS is producing good built up for apps but color response of screen is bitter annoying when use for longtime e.g.  gaming or watching movies,6. rear 13+2 MP camera working nicely in day and pretty light condition. in low light photos are somwhat blurry ...but for this budget this camera setup is outstanding, and suffice the purpose. front 8 MP camera is good for daytime selfies and screen flash is also working good.,7. Face unlock is very fast and responsive and working well in low light.,8, battery is long lasting but takes 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. this is the only con of this that this does not have fast charging mode but again nothing could be better than this phone.,9. speaker sound is impressive,10, dual sim mode working fine.,Now the small glimpse of cons- 1. battery charging time is longer about 3 to 4 hrs for full charge from nil battery.,2. OS coloring is not that much good. i think OS upgrade will short out this problem.,except everything is outstanding...you can go for this phone without a hassle if your budget is within 9k, No other phone can beat this phone in this budget."
It's awesome as usual expected from Amazon!!!,"Battery life is really awesome, sound quality top class, in looks no.1, feels really comfortable in hand, the notch thing is also really good camera as expected from oppo it's really really good and this phone comes with a portrait mode as well I just loved the color!!! Just go for it .... But let me tell you if you're looking for big storage go for the 32gb variant Because in this only 7GB is usable rest of the storage got eaten by the system OS 😅 but it's a good thing that it has 2 sim slots and both supports 4G and it comes with a dedicated sd card slot..."
Very nice phone,Battery backup is osam...... overall phone parfomance is fabulous.... I love my phone
Good mobile on 10k range,"Overall it's a good phone on 10k price with good battery backup, camera quality...it's been a week since i bought this phone and no issues found especially on heating problems and lagging issues after several app usage.,My only only concern would be on screen display, especially outdoors.."
Good product,Nice
Opportunity,A very fine mobile but a little expensive considering its features! But overall a very Good set.
GOT A STEAL DEAL FM AMAZON,"It's an excellent phone under ten grands. The battery life is splendid. Camera output on either side is superlative for the price range.,I checked up the price at 8local stores giving full page ads but found Amazon almost at same price. However, the additional benifit on Amazon makes it much better.,I got a discount of two grands on exchange as well.,So... Please go for it if looking for a decent budget phone. I got it for my daughter.,Thanks Amazon.,Update on Product: After about two month of usage, the speed has gone so lethargic as if am using 2G Era mobile. The internal memory doesn't allow stuff to be shifted to external memory. Whole lot of unwanted factory installed Apps, which one can't uninstall...,Changing from 5 to 3 Star the product only."
Best when you buy with Amazon during offers.,"The phone is very nice although a bit costly ( 12500) Market price . Picture quality is decent and battery life is superb.,Amazon provided me a very decent discount and I bought it for approximately 9700rs which was during offers. (1000rs Amazon pay balance included in the cashback.)"
Nice product but not the best.,This phone looks same as shown in the image but the video quality is poor and also I didn't get any sim tool ejector.
Camera quality,The camera quality is to bat...
Paisa wasuul !!,"Awesome phone !!,Full paisa wasuul !!"
Not as we expected...,There is no indication light for missed calls message alert and not also for battery is changing or not this is the biggest draw back of this model phone and it is where worst charging time for full charge it takes 4 hours...
Stylish and picture perfect,"Nice phone, gloosy back looks cool and gives a premium phone feel.... Performance wise it's very good in it's segment...only drawback is no Fingerprint sensor. Also having little problem with the software notification settings but it's a software issue, maybe rectified in a next update. As for camera quality, oppo never disappoint in that"
Good phone with solid battery,"Solid battery and crystal clear voice clarity.,Would recommend to go for it."
Ohk ohk display.,Good fone for starter.
Great,Love it
"Exchanged for Xperia Z1, still a good deal","Picture and Sound is average performance, battery is good, internet is okay but sometimes it feels like 4G is having 3G speed and 3G is having 2G speed"
Best oppo,"Nice mobile.oppo best low budget mobile. Camera superb,sound good.touch software nice.bettery excellent.big screen full view.i think best phone on this budget."
First of thanks Amazon,Very good phone I suggest to my friends this phone is very best for battery backup and camera clarity thank you Amazon
"Battery backup, Display, Sound, Speed Very good.No heating but charging time too long.","Super Phone,Battery backup, Display, Sound, Speed Very good but charging time too long."
Very nice product,"Very good battery backup, good Camera, no heating problem,,In short it's value for money.,Only thing is I have not received SIM card ejection pin in the box. But no issue you can buy this phone."
Average features but looks great,Screen resolution at this price is very bad.only 720p. No fingerprint sensor. Got this in great deal of exchange offer.
Good Phone but missing finger Print Scanner,Battery Charger given with 1A secondary which takes complete charging to 3 hr. Fast charging option would be better in this price range
Good phone,Nice
Best mobile at this price,Got it during sale and worth every penny. Screen is so large and beautiful. Being used for more than 5 months with no problem whatsoever. 100 times better than xaomi.
Dont waste your money on this,I buy this befor 3 days ago nd it start hanging nd the pucture quality us vry bad
"Great phone, great price, screen could do better.",Great phone. My only qualms are that there is on LED indicator while charging. And the fact that the screen glass is very prone to scratches. So it's essential to buy a tempered glass protector.
The product is worth.,I bought this for my mom and she is really very happy with the product
Very good product below 10k tag line...,Very good product below 10k tag line...
A nice midranger from OPPO,This phone is a good medium range phone with excellent battery life. Lasts for 2 days with average use. The front camera is very good. The picture quality is equal to A83 and the sound quality is good but low in volume. Overall a nice phone from OPPO.
Good,"V good,As per my expectations.,Product is superb.,Amazon have best associates like Priyanka J in customer service.,She gives every solutions very honestly and with 100 percentagequality."
Nice phone,Good to use. As expected as satisfied. Now 4month gone. Not even a issue. Phone processing speed is ultimate. Nice design notch one. Love it to use. No problem you can buy you will satisfied.
Fantastic product.,Nice phone. Notch display rocks.
Dead,"Suddenly phone is dead,,Very bad experience from Oppo.,Near about 2 months its working fine but now it’s not starting.,This is my first phone from oppo, and the last one.😖😖😤😤"
Awesome phone with grt specs,The best phone at this price...I first bought one for my wife in red colour I liked it so much that I bought for myself as well in purple. The camera quality is so good that my friends with iPhone 10 are liking the pictures of Oppo A3s
Recommended,"Recommended ...all feature r good ...came with screen protector and transferant cover.,Using from last 3 months and all good"
Ok not nice,Oppo a3s camera is not good... But battery backup awesome... I m happy for battery backup and sound quality... 😊
Very fast delivery good mobile.,Mobile phone good quality working but price is most compar ram and internel gp. very fast and good delivery thanks amazon.
Good product.,Battery life long last... And the picture quality is good. Sounds louder than other phones. Nice phone from oppo. I got this phone in exchange. Good deal. Thank you amazon
Go for it,Very good in below 10k
Nice but should have been a bit better,Screen resolution should have been a bit better by applying 3D viewing in this phone with full HD amoled display. But overall a good smartphone at this price. Also price should have been a bit low somewhat around 8000 approximately.
No regrets.,Finger print recognition would have been very helpful.
Overall awesome product,"It's a good product in affordable price, all quality are best.,Go for it"
Good,Its good.
It worths its price,The phone is really good. Good battery life and I recommend it to everyone.
BEST ON THE CATEGORY,"THIS ONE LIT,DAMN COLOR,DISPLAY CLARITY IS SUPERB,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Best product but still to improve,About notification swiping we can't swipe notification instead we have to delete or drag down for cancel also long six digit password very uncomfortable to open everytime.
Nice one,Brought for my wife. Good one. Decent camera. I liked the build and it comes with a transparent back case and covered tampered glass / screen guard. Audio i s nice. Overall good. I liked he build mostly..
Ok,"Everything is good,But handset was missing in the package,Got disappointed"
Storage space not given as per addj 16 gb,"I have purchased oppo A3s &found 8.5gb internal storage instead of 16 gb. Very disappointed to see this fault. Amazon should not include in sell.,Is anyone have same issue withis device"
part missing,overall product is very good but there is handset not available in the box. its disappointing.

Great product in this price range,Great product in this price range
Pathetic service by Amazon,Sim is not getting detected . Such a defective product sent by Amazon. When I'm asking for refunf people are saying they can only do replacement. Pathetic service by Amazon
Overall 3.5,Its battery life is weak it's work normally for one Day not for two days and basically the price is too much without finger print sensor
Processing too bad,"Not good,but ok,, processing too slow,,network issue ,some time loose network,,Last one processing toobad"

Best Phone at this price range,"The Phone has a great Camera, Big Screen, a good processor and a nice video, audio quality and better overall standards considering its price. The delivery by amazon was also prompt and safe. But unlike the other phones, the earphones were not included in Box."
"Good battery backup, nice camera, dedicated micro SD card slot.","Phone is nice. Good battery backup and nice camera. Screen is HD+ but it's fine by me. Dedicated memory card slot to increase the storage, great work done by oppo. However it does not support fast charging and it takes a lot of time to charge. Overall it's a nice phone in this range."
Nice product,"Amazing mobile,1 camera is amazing,2 battery life is good,3 picture amazing,All feature are very nice"
Lovely phone,"Nice phone in this range.,Super fast delivery. Camera is awesome and so is the battery life"
Go to Redmi or Realme,"Pros,1. Elegant design,2. Good battery backup,3. Nice camera,4. Split screen,5. Face lock,Cons,1. Very slow charging time,2. Heavy weight,3. Huge display ( iPhone users lol.),4. Low internal memory"
Verry. Nice phone,Picture quality good sound quality verry good
Oppo a3s,Awesome battery backup
Looks nice,little over priced
Good phone for daily use,Lack of fingerprint sensor. Otherwise fine. A bit high price when compared to other brands
Best phone in range of 10k must buy.,"The processor is good, battery life is awsome, camera is really good then what I was expecting, features in it are good for the price which is offered, rich look oppo did good job in copying iphone X look. Overall phone is best, Loved it."
Looks,"Two days Fast delivery service to berhampur,odisha.Beautiful design, strong battary life, no legs even 2gb ram, camera quality ok in this price point view. Value for money"
Amazing phone.. love it..,Amazing phone with super longer battery power... all is super well but not getting oppo Headphone in packing assessries.. it was deeply hurt to missing headphone..
Very heavy and not ergonomically designed,Phone could be good. Performance is very good. But it is very heavy and not ergonomically designed. My fingers are paining while using it. You can simply return as that’s the policy. Unless there is any fault with the product one can’t return.
Exelent,Very good mobile in all respect nothing to say negative only minor point if it has a physical notification led then it would be super in all aspects.
I like amazon always,Thank u give me a best quality
headphone Missing.,Good phone.inside no headphone.
Over All Phone is Good. Only concern about  Headset,Phone is good. And also delivery was good. But I am not happy with one thing. in product description is mentioned Headset with the phone. but I did not get any Headset with this phone.
Oppo a3s good phone,Nice phone
Beautiful colour and awesome camera quality,"It's really good and awesome phone,Thanks to amazon delivered on time"
