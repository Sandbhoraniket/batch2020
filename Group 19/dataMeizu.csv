"Brilliant price point for Meizu C9 , Full view Display/2GB/16GB/ 3000mAh . I really wanna ditch my 4GB/64GB phone for this Fab Meizu phone",5.0 out of 5 stars
Solid touch. Bright and vibrant display. Very responsive...was extremely impressed. Off the bat runs a keyboard called TouchPal which I junked in favour of GBoard by installing from apk before logging on to google. Other than that no bloatware. I didnt test the camera. If this phone is priced 5K then 5K phones have come far in the last few years. Would recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"After struggling with a string of FlymeOS phones from Meizu, I bought this one for the stock Android. Other than the low (16 GB) memory, there i nothing much to complain about. The size is perfect, it has two SIM and an exclusive SD slot AND no crapware! Google services works without fuss, and the face recognition is great too!",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought it for Brand name and Big screen but FACE ID and camera  features are my favorite now!,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought it for around 4k and at that price range it sure is great. The picture quality is good, it has 13 mp back and 8 front and the quality is good just as you would expect. The build quality is not that great it's kinda delicate so you must buy a hard case. And it's light weight.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"comparing the price, i believe its good deal. Most of features are as advertised. This is utility phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The worst product I received from Amazon. It's 13 Mega pixels is only in writing. In performance it's not even five mega pixels. Sound quality is also the worst.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I am having network problem in this phone.I am having airtle 4g postpaid connection and the mobile shows only 2g ""E""connection. Please suggest a way out tried doing stting change on off and all the process . That same sim card is working fine on all other mobiles.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Meizu is a great brand and produce quality products but it has scanty presence of service centers.Thus in case of a defective set you will go from pillar to post to find a center.Unless it goes full hog to provide basic repair facility in India it has no future in India.Otherwise it is a good product worth a buy.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Very handy, it has great form factor. I am an iPhone SE user and bought this phone as a second device for a VoLTE usage. However, I was amazed by the performance for this small stock android beast. It is flawless. Not for heavy usage but can be easily used as a second device.",5.0 out of 5 stars
