        ",Very dull display in sun light time . Outside  You can't view and read letters . Easily broke the touch screen. If I m using screen protector
"
        ",RAM 2GB IN 10990 IS NOT JUSTIFIED WHEN REALME 2 PRO IS COMING WITH BETTER HARDWARE WITHIN THE SAME PRICE
"
        ",Best budget phone in market...battery life superb never went to finish up to 2 day of regular use..no  heating problems and there was no lagging issues at all face detection gives accuracy shocks in the night as it increases screen brightness to be high and detects you quickly and also the camera deserve a medal again nice combo pack in just 10000/-

"
        ","This is my comprehensive review about the OPPO A3S, 2 GB ram, 16GB ROM"
"
        ","Battery life is really awesome, sound quality top class, in looks no.1, feels really comfortable in hand, the notch thing is also really good camera as expected from oppo it's really really good and this phone comes with a portrait mode as well I just loved the color!!! Just go for it .... But let me tell you if you're looking for big storage go for the 32gb variant Because in this only 7GB is usable rest of the storage got eaten by the system OS 😅 but it's a good thing that it has 2 sim slots and both supports 4G and it comes with a dedicated sd card slot..."
